Whenever we fly he sets off the machines because he had two hip replacements.  He is pulled aside, along with other elderly men, and damn near strip searched.  A stranger\u2019s hands run up and down his legs up to his crotch, and he\u2019s even been asked to unzip and open his pants!  In Hawaii, flying from one island to another, his bare feet were wanded, and he asked the tsa agent if he felt like a fool doing this to him.  As all this is going on, I\u2019m trying to gather items from two bins and then stand aside waiting for my husband to be freed from the indignity. And to see unvetted foreigners who contributed absolutely nothing to our country get on a plane on our dime without having to undergo these searches is galling!  Diseases we haven\u2019t seen in decades are reappearing.  Our hospitals are turning away Americans in favor of illegals, and many hospitals have shuttered..  Veterans and elderly have been tossed out of homes.  Crime has increased as foreigners prey on Americans.  I will NEVER vote for another democrat.  They have endangered our people and country while using our money to pay for these lawbreakers as Americans struggle to feed their own and keep a roof over their heads.  And the final indignity - the body searches while foreigners fly free. "}

It's apparent that Biden is too far gone, has a mental disconnect, or there's another reason for his absurd behavior of disregarding the welfare of the U.S. population in favor of those coming in by the boatload/thousands.

And comparatively quiet electric cars are no substitute.\u00a0It\u2019s no longer prudent to have so much of society, especially our primary modes of transportation, reliant on traditional sources of energy.\u00a0But industry and fossil-fuel friendly government can tell when a very large portion of the populace is too overworked, worried and even angry about food and housing unaffordability for themselves or their family \u2014 all while on insufficient income \u2014 to criticize the industry [etcetera] for whatever environmental damage their policies cause/allow, particularly when not immediately observable.\u00a0Even as bone-dry-vegetation regions uncontrollably burn, mass addiction to fossil fuel products undoubtedly helps keep the average consumer quiet about the planet\u2019s greatest polluter, lest they feel and/or be publicly deemed hypocritical. It must be convenient for the industry.But the world \u2014 very much including Western nations \u2014 desperately needs to behave smarter with vehicular fuel consumption, therefore all need to forgo purchasing the most gratuitously environmentally hazardous of vehicles."}

If parents who chose not to have their children against Measles were confused b/c of their distrust of vaccines due to Fauci's alleged blunders with Covid-19, why didn't these parents discuss this with their Pediatrician, who undoubtedly would have strongly urged the vaccination? Or, do you also believe that Pediatricians who advise the tried and tested vaccines that have kept us all safe for decades are misguided?  If we had forgone vaccination, masks and social distancing, we'd have gotten to herd immunity for sure but the death toll would have been vastly greater than it has been and hospital ERs and ICUs would have been even more overwhelmed.  To state that Fauci is responsible for today's Measles outbreaks is to imply that medicine is an exact science.  It is not.   "}

One should probably look more at the anti-vaxxer movement (which was around since BEFORE Covid) and look for answers there as to why we are seeing a resurgence of diseases. It isn't immigration, it isn't government-designed. It is because people have made conscious choices to not be vaccinated, and therefore are susceptible to infection. Cause meet Effect.

That sounds hypocritical.  And in most cases if you don't take a vax you're primarily only putting yourself at risk. Yes, I get a risk to pregnant women but that is not like a massive pandemic risk such as covid.  And if I'm vaxed & your not, I won't get measles or mumps from you. So no risk.

I believe the Mets are prepared to allow Alonso's FA to play out and find his true market value - as the Yankees did with Judge and the Mets have done previously with Nimmo.  When you have the wealthiest owner in sports, who can match or outbid any offer, you can afford to take these gambles.  No, the Mets DO NOT NEED to trade Alonso now, OR at the trade deadline.  If Uncle Steve wants Pete in NY, he will be here."}

He is one of the premier home run hitters in the league, hits a 100RBIs, plays a better-than-average first base, is a team leader, loves NY, and can easily be transitioned over to DH. It baffles me. It seems both the Yankees and Mets are always willing to overpay for other people's players, but for their own, they tighten the purse strings. What's the hang-up? His WAR isn't high enough... ridiculous."}

They allowed all the migrants into sanctuary cities (I think ours was the first), and did not have a plan for what might happen if more than what they thought would flood the US came in. None of these people were vetted for possible viruses, or diseases  they were bringing into our country, how New Yorkers and citizens in other states would be affected and infected. Programs were cut, children were forced to go to remote learning for one day, while migrants slept in their gymnasium,  and the elderly split up and sent to different nursing homes while the one they were living in was used to house migrants, and the crime they brought with them (fighting in the streets and killing each other). Now our cherished communities are being used as public bathrooms. They are also going out at night, using their children, to go door to door waking up residents at all hours to ask for money. They came into our cities, and should've been held to the same standards as its citizens. Especially, when it comes to their children. CPS would have a truckload of cases, on top of what it already has, to deal with them. As a matter of fact, the children who are citizens would fall deeper into the pile where they are forgotten, leaving them in the hands of cruel parents. If they are being sheltered, they need to have a curfew on them, just like the natural citizens. I was homeless with my son nearly 30 years ago, and we had a curfew of 6pm. "}

The most prosperous times in NYC over the same time frame was when Republicans controlled the Governors and Mayor's office. In the 1980s it was Democrat mayor Ed Koch that gave you sanctuary cities. Do you remember why? Elected officials wanted to make sure asylum seekers would not be afraid to report crimes or enroll their kids in public school and get medical care over fear of being deported. 40 years later after virtue signaling, crimes are being committed by these illegals all over the city, schools are bursting at the seams, schools are being closed to accommodate them, homeless vets are being displaced from shelters, Americans and residents have to pay exorbitant health care costs while illegals get free health care, housing and food, and none are deported. On top of that, you've voted for cashless bail, DAs that refuse to prosecute, illegal protests that block traffic and put lives in danger, and other other things that allow the inmates to run the asylum. So don't complain when this is exactly what you've been voting for the past 60 years. "}

They knew they had a problem because many owners never looked at \"the content of their character\" with non-white coaches. They never gave them a chance to compete for the jobs. The kept recycling the same coaches, many of whom had losing records with multiple teams. For years, interviews with non-white coaches were all show, with owners never giving those candidates real consideration. The success of Mike Tomlin and, more recently, Todd Bowles, suggests that giving black coaches a chance to interview for a job can work well for a team, and in the NFL, everyone tries to copy success. Remember. the Rooney Rule does not require hiring someone, merely that you interview minority coaches. If they earn the job with the interview- Great. If they do not - so be it. Why whine about giving people a chance? Isn't it the American Dream to have a chance to succeed?"}

According to what I've read in the article, it seems that No. 1, there is enough evidence to prove that the Pediatrician stopped, gave statements, and then left.  Number 2, there is no law, even if you are a MD, that precludes this Pediatrician to give aid to a victim of an accident, the MD is protected.  No. 3, it's quite possible that the Pediatrician does not have the skills/training or practice for life-saving emergencies or is not comfortable doing so for many reasons, seems like it would be a bad judgement that he left the scene, but not criminal.

And a woman who used to have sex with a lot of young men before she converted (St. Mary of Egypt). So, Mr. LaBeouf, you don't have to worry about your movie past, if you are.I'm an Asian man (a cradle Catholic) in my mid-40s who used to look at adult material, but now had stopped. And now I'm stronger in my faith and I've learned to fear thy Lord. It's important to fear thy Lord, according to St. Paul...I don't want God to hate me because I don't want to go to Hell, that's what I always say in my prayers. I believe fearing thy Lord really helps people to stop sinning gravely. I hope you and everyone here in the comments section to take care.Love in Christ, Kenny"}

There's a Catholic saint who used to worship Satan before he converted (Blessed Bartolo Longo). And those who murdered people before they converted to Catholicism (St. Moses The Ethiopian and St. Olga, for example). And a woman who used to have sex with a lot of young men before she converted (St. Mary of Egypt). So, Mr. LaBeouf, you don't have to worry about your movie past, if you are.I'm an Asian man (a cradle Catholic) in my mid-40s who used to look at adult material, but now had stopped. And now I'm stronger in my faith and I've learned to fear thy Lord. It's important to fear thy Lord, according to St. Paul...I don't want God to hate me because I don't want to go to Hell, that's what I always say in my prayers. I believe fearing thy Lord really helps people to stop sinning gravely. I hope you and everyone here in the comments section to take care.Love in Christ, Kenny"}

{"uid": 1705771841274719, "text": "Let me get this straight. Criticism of anything Jewish is antisemitism? How does anything grow or thrive in a vacuum? Criticism is not always meant to be negative. In fact, it can be an incredibly valuable tool for growth and improvement. Being critical is making note of merits and flaws in a given topic. Perhaps one should consider how criticism in itself is fraught with fallacies - eg., petito principii or \" begging the question\"   or  the False dilemma fallacy.Being critical isn\u2019t being hateful by definition. Saying what is true and what isn\u2019t true is not an act of hate. Done graciously it\u2019s an act of love, of charity, of kindness. It is done out of regard for one\u2019s fellow-man, out of concern for their well-being and that care must extend to the manner in which questions are investigated and truth is announced. There is truth. We should seek it and we should reject the lazy identification of the search for truth with hate.Critical - adjective. 1. Containing or making severe or negatve judgements.2. Containing careful or analytical evaluations. "}

{"uid": 1705771841274720, "text": "To have genuine representative democracy, there first needs to be a truly democratic electoral system for the citizenry. The electoral system is a large part of the illusion masquerading as real democracy. And, of course, many voters get to wait in long, bad-weather lineups to participate.While the First Past The Post ballot [FPTP] may qualify, though barely at that, as democratic within the democracy spectrum, it is the proportionally representative system thus governance that's truly representative, regardless of political ideology.FPTP does seem to serve corporate lobbyists well, however. I believe it is why such powerful interests generally resist attempts at changing from FPTP to proportional representation electoral systems of governance, the latter which dilutes corporate influence. Low-representation FPTP-elected governments, in which a relatively small portion of the country's populace is actually electorally represented, are likely the easiest for lobbyists to manipulate or \u2018buy\u2019.It can and often enough does enable the biggest of businesses to get unaccountably even bigger, defying the very spirit of government rules established to ensure healthy competition by limiting mass consolidation."}

There are people who have legitimate concerns or health concerns which may warrant remote work which cannot work remotely but the D.A. is continuing to pay her a hefty salary and bonus for staying home.  This is an outrage and should be enough for us to elect someone new."}
