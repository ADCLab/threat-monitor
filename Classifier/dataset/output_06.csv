And some migrants who actually were seen in immigration court were coached to request an extension - because the longer in the U.S. the less likely to be deported, and most are cognizant of having no grounds for asylum. They are economic migrants. And as they wait they know to head to a city like NY or Chicago where the taxpayers will be forced to provide them with free housing, free food and free medical care. The obvious solution is to restrict humanitarian parole. But guess who is against restricting it? The Democrats.

Fauci, a world-recognized expert in Virology and Immunology  who spent 5 decades building his reputation, is undeserving of your contempt.  If parents who chose not to have their children against Measles were confused b/c of their distrust of vaccines due to Fauci's alleged blunders with Covid-19, why didn't these parents discuss this with their Pediatrician, who undoubtedly would have strongly urged the vaccination? Or, do you also believe that Pediatricians who advise the tried and tested vaccines that have kept us all safe for decades are misguided?  If we had forgone vaccination, masks and social distancing, we'd have gotten to herd immunity for sure but the death toll would have been vastly greater than it has been and hospital ERs and ICUs would have been even more overwhelmed.

Programs were cut, children were forced to go to remote learning for one day, while migrants slept in their gymnasium,  and the elderly split up and sent to different nursing homes while the one they were living in was used to house migrants, and the crime they brought with them (fighting in the streets and killing each other). Now our cherished communities are being used as public bathrooms. They are also going out at night, using their children, to go door to door waking up residents at all hours to ask for money. They came into our cities, and should've been held to the same standards as its citizens. Especially, when it comes to their children. CPS would have a truckload of cases, on top of what it already has, to deal with them. As a matter of fact, the children who are citizens would fall deeper into the pile where they are forgotten, leaving them in the hands of cruel parents.

And those who murdered people before they converted to Catholicism (St. Moses The Ethiopian and St. Olga, for example). And a woman who used to have sex with a lot of young men before she converted (St. Mary of Egypt). So, Mr. LaBeouf, you don't have to worry about your movie past, if you are.I'm an Asian man (a cradle Catholic) in my mid-40s who used to look at adult material, but now had stopped. And now I'm stronger in my faith and I've learned to fear thy Lord. It's important to fear thy Lord, according to St. Paul...I don't want God to hate me because I don't want to go to Hell, that's what I always say in my prayers. I believe fearing thy Lord really helps people to stop sinning gravely.

Perhaps one should consider how criticism in itself is fraught with fallacies - eg., petito principii or "" begging the question""   or  the False dilemma fallacy.Being critical isn‚Äôt being hateful by definition. Saying what is true and what isn‚Äôt true is not an act of hate. Done graciously it‚Äôs an act of love, of charity, of kindness. It is done out of regard for one‚Äôs fellow-man, out of concern for their well-being and that care must extend to the manner in which questions are investigated and truth is announced.

I believe it is why such powerful interests generally resist attempts at changing from FPTP to proportional representation electoral systems of governance, the latter which dilutes corporate influence.
