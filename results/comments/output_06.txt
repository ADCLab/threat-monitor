Content     : Very few illegals encountered at the border carry any legitimate government issued ID. They simply supply a name, date of birth, and country of origin. About the only thing verifiable on the alien registration document is the processing agent's name. Once in a while the fingerprints will hit if they were previously arrested in America, or their fingerprints/DNA were lifted of IED fragments. However most are just set free in America. They might get vaccinations later, after they are released. We can't make them take vaccinations, because the US only gave liability protection to drug companies for US citizens.FJB, finish the wall, return to enforcing our immigration laws.

Content     : I love it. Next time I‚Äôm going to say I‚Äôm an illegal and don‚Äôt have any papers and see what they say even though I‚Äôm born and raised in SoCal. A few months back I‚Äôm in SeaTac for business and this Guatemalan was in the first class/business line. She was lost and the Somalian line checker asked for her ticket and ID and said you speak English,she said no. I do from school so I asked her. She was illegal in Washington and had a Guatemalan drivers license. The best part was she had a piece of paper from tsa allowing her to go through with no ticket to meet her family illegally from Denver. So we  rapped for a few, got her to her gate (on Alaska like me) and there was her husband and 3 kids. She was mucho gracias, her husband, nope. Was a rude bleep. Thank you joey. Keep up the great work and our moneyüëéüèª

Content     : Democrats have absolutely zero grounds to complain when Trump is re-elected. You reap what you sow and if this is the America that you are trying to build, expect push back. Trump will win and the democrats and their policies are the reason why.  Spare me the feigned outrage come November.  The winds of change are coming and it falls directly into the lap of the democrats in charge.

Content     : Thank you traitor Joe Biden for never putting America first. Remember folks, the movies and Disney trips support Jeffrey Katzenberg Biden's number one source for funding the Democrats. Katzenberg has given 3 million to Democrats the last few years and 7K to all other candidates. Every time you go to the movies, or visit Disney, Katzenberg the Billionaire gets a piece of your fee. He made sure Michael Eisner returned to Disney and was paid 40 million this years to help fund Joe Biden. We the American people need to close down Disney once and for all. It is a hotbed for Sodom and Gamora. Short Disney stock, make sure it is not in your portfolio, and anyone you know. We must root out evil everywhere to change this country. I don't even have Netflix, that's how much I hate Hollywood.

Content     : My husband is 82 years old.  He served 38 years in the National Guard and held a full time job.  Whenever we fly he sets off the machines because he had two hip replacements.  He is pulled aside, along with other elderly men, and damn near strip searched.  A stranger‚Äôs hands run up and down his legs up to his crotch, and he‚Äôs even been asked to unzip and open his pants!  In Hawaii, flying from one island to another, his bare feet were wanded, and he asked the tsa agent if he felt like a fool doing this to him.  As all this is going on, I‚Äôm trying to gather items from two bins and then stand aside waiting for my husband to be freed from the indignity. And to see unvetted foreigners who contributed absolutely nothing to our country get on a plane on our dime without having to undergo these searches is galling!  Diseases we haven‚Äôt seen in decades are reappearing.  Our hospitals are turning away Americans in favor of illegals, and many hospitals have shuttered..  Veterans and elderly have been tossed out of homes.  Crime has increased as foreigners prey on Americans.  I will NEVER vote for another democrat.  They have endangered our people and country while using our money to pay for these lawbreakers as Americans struggle to feed their own and keep a roof over their heads.  And the final indignity - the body searches while foreigners fly free.

They have privileges American citizens do not, along with tons of free stuff only illegals receive, not to mention the depressed job market and wages, the rise in crime and drug addiction, overcrowded schools and hospitals, etc.   This is what the Biden Regime's Great American Population Replacement policy looks like, even though the DC Uniparty and MSM dismisses that toxic reality as a mere "racist conspiracy theory."    Except for paying the taxes funding our own demise, Americans have no relevant role to play in this "radical transformation" of what used to be our own country into a Third World authoritarian Administrative State.

You know this because the left gets irate when you talk about the replacement theory, so you know you‚Äôre hitting a nerve when they start flipping out when it‚Äôs brought up.

These illegals are coming from Venezuela, Honduras, the continent of Africa, all places where leftist socialists have ruined their countries and economies forcing them to trek here. So one would think these people would not vote for the same lunatic polices again. But for some reason they do. If Republicans were smart, and Lord knows I have my doubts sometimes, they would develop an education policy for these people to understand that the democrats are in no way, shape, or form their friends.

Content     : I go to DMV to renew my CDL License with what I thought was all the necessary paperwork only to be told it wasn't enough . While I am waiting to speak to a supervisor two people who cant speak English or have any identification are being led around by DMV workers to ensure that what they need to get a license is taken care of . I am sent away after being told I dont have what is needed to renew my CDL, but these two are led around from window to window to make sure they get what they came for. And know they can get on a plane with no identification , its got to stop and it needs to stop KNOW.

Americans, especially senior citizens and homeless are struggling to pay for housing  of any kind.We either pay for medcal care or dont get any. Dont get much health care even when we pay.   Biden justified the school take over as housing  and the food they were furnished, as  being important that the  immigrants are warm, well fed  and comfortable.  Of course they also go voter Id cards  already marked for the democrats. Amercans are living on the street with little to no  food , shelter from the rain and snow . Whats wrong with this picture and when will the democrates  stop voting for Biden and the leftcauses just because they dont want tovote for Trump.

Why this additional scanner needed if you take off belt, shoes, jacket, no bag (which goes through another xray anyway).Three - they pat down, (and I've seen this traveling for 23 years since 9/11), old elderly people (all races but mostly white), children (all races but mostly white), white men, white woman, etc. NONE of which would be profiled for said potential acts.You can PAY for fast track to the gate and avoid the line. They do a background check. But what's the difference when you show your ID and have zero criminal background which they can see once scanning your Driver's License of Gov. ID. or Passport. They can check that too when you pay for your ticket. They can check that too when you get to the airport and check in your bags either with Sky Caps or inside at the counter or at a kiosk. Eff G. Bush for doing this to the American people. They took away our rights by having us patted down at airport with NO criminal act committed. Totally against the Constitution.

It's apparent that Biden is too far gone, has a mental disconnect, or there's another reason for his absurd behavior of disregarding the welfare of the U.S. population in favor of those coming in by the boatload/thousands. It appears Biden isn't even releasing economic support to the states that are dealing with this unsustainable situation.

Remember the U.S. Census done last time they cannot ask if the households living in each district if they are American citizens or not. The Democrats want to control all branches of the government and rule Americans for as long as they can and turn America into San Francisco, Chicago, New York and Philadelphia and all the nasty Democrat ran cities in America. No borders, No culture. This is how the Democrats are destroying America. More and more people must wake up to the evil plans Democrats have in mind.

Content     : And she's gonna play the race card every chance she gets. For those who call this post racist? Well, race only truly entered into it once she cried it. Before that point, it was simply impartial corruption and venal stupidity. Folks, equality doesn't speak to this grasping clown circus in any way. And equity can't dig down deep enough to forgive or eliminate every flagrant act. As a Georgian, I am embarrassed. And yet, unsurprised.

Content     : Back when the Rangers went to Montreal to play the Canadiens I decided to put $10 on the Habs. Having been a Rangers fans since 74 and having gone to many Rangers' games in Montreal,  I was pretty confident that I wouldn't be losing my measly $10. I won $21 and then decided to roll that into the next game and so on. Ended up losing $300 when they finally squeaked out that win against Washington. So I waited a couple of games and decided to place a $10 bet last night. All this to say that I will be putting my winnings down on the Kings tomorrow in the hopes that I lose my money to see the Rangers win. You may ask why I am doing this. I will tell you that if the odds makers are going to keep making the Rangers the favourites,  then I will take advantage of this slump and make some money. I want the Rangers to win tomorrow but if they don't at least I can make some money. Hey I already lost $300 didn't I?

Content     : Quick might be up for this game, but will the core? I guess we shall see. Every team goes thru this, it's a long season the cup is not won in January. Hopefully they get it together like early season. 5X5 they have issues. Why? One reason is injuries. Two, Rangers not had a #1 line for a while. ZBad & Kreider. who else? Wheeler? Vesey? Kakko? The number one line has been running of 2 cylinders for a few years now. They not replaced Buchnevich yet. They need a top 6 RW. NOW!!The Trochek, Panarin, Laffy line has carried this team somewhat. But other than that? ZILCH. Uhhh that's the #2 line right? Defense? Trouba (plays for 2) He's not had a stable D partner for a few years now. His NO-HIT/CONTACT partner is marginal at best. Gustaffson has been the best pick up in years. Fox is off. he might be playing hurt. Lindgren plays to his ability. Is all heart. Wish they could put his determination into the CORE. This is what we got now folks. Ranger team floundering. Best we can hope for is form them to go .500 on this 4 game road trip. After Kings, they have two games they should win no? lol. But we been here before Ranger fans right? LGR!

He should be welcomed royally by the Kings crowd for what he did for that franchise. A true winner in all respects! This is set up nicely for him to star tonight in a win upon his return to LA for the first timesince being traded.

We have too many LAZY forwards who tend to watch the play instead of engaging the offensive players and being in their face and making it hard on them. This squad needs to be trimmed and redefined into a hockey club that is hard to play against. The current personnel just isn't capable of pulling off this feat.

Lindgren and Gus took the hardest checks of the night, but didn't show any ill effects. If needed, do we see Jones with Robertson as the 7th. D-man?

Content     : While this article is about Quick and I wish him the best, the elephant in the room needs to be addressed.  K'Andre Miller is one of the biggest problems on the NYR.  His regression, not utilizing his size and positioning, his bad decisions and most importantly his mental health are huge red flags.  If it weren't for Trouba, Miller would be a -20 or more.  When is the management going to sit him and in my opinion, shop him?  He's going to ask for Pulock money, which he is not worth.  I had high hopes for the kid.  It's apparent it's not going to work on the NYR.  He was a winger in his youth, maybe they should experiment putting his on the 4th line LW.  He is a defensive liability when he is on the ice. I think the kid is a lost cause.

Content     : Back when the Rangers went to Montreal to play the Canadiens I decided to put $10 on the Habs. Having been a Rangers fans since 74 and having gone to many Rangers' games in Montreal,  I was pretty confident that I wouldn't be losing my measly $10. I won $21 and then decided to roll that into the next game and so on. Ended up losing $300 when they finally squeaked out that win against Washington. So I waited a couple of games and decided to place a $10 bet last night. All this to say that I will be putting my winnings down on the Kings tomorrow in the hopes that I lose my money to see the Rangers win. You may ask why I am doing this. I will tell you that if the odds makers are going to keep making the Rangers the favourites,  then I will take advantage of this slump and make some money. I want the Rangers to win tomorrow but if they don't at least I can make some money. Hey I already lost $300 didn't I?

It was Roman Czechmanek in goal. Jeremy Roenick hated him. I also got to meet Mario Tremblay outside the locker room, the Kings were playing Minnesota.

Content     : Quick might be up for this game, but will the core? I guess we shall see. Every team goes thru this, it's a long season the cup is not won in January. Hopefully they get it together like early season. 5X5 they have issues. Why? One reason is injuries. Two, Rangers not had a #1 line for a while. ZBad & Kreider. who else? Wheeler? Vesey? Kakko? The number one line has been running of 2 cylinders for a few years now. They not replaced Buchnevich yet. They need a top 6 RW. NOW!!The Trochek, Panarin, Laffy line has carried this team somewhat. But other than that? ZILCH. Uhhh that's the #2 line right? Defense? Trouba (plays for 2) He's not had a stable D partner for a few years now. His NO-HIT/CONTACT partner is marginal at best. Gustaffson has been the best pick up in years. Fox is off. he might be playing hurt. Lindgren plays to his ability. Is all heart. Wish they could put his determination into the CORE. This is what we got now folks. Ranger team floundering. Best we can hope for is form them to go .500 on this 4 game road trip. After Kings, they have two games they should win no? lol. But we been here before Ranger fans right? LGR!

He should be welcomed royally by the Kings crowd for what he did for that franchise. A true winner in all respects! This is set up nicely for him to star tonight in a win upon his return to LA for the first timesince being traded. The team in front of him better play work hard and play competitive hockey for him to help get the result he deserves.

Content     : Defense isn't about a goalie and two D's, it's about a 5 man unit all working to control puck possession in their own zone. We have too many LAZY forwards who tend to watch the play instead of engaging the offensive players and being in their face and making it hard on them. This squad needs to be trimmed and redefined into a hockey club that is hard to play against. The current personnel just isn't capable of pulling off this feat.

Content     : I just earlier commented on how people treat drug use as being normal and how the use of fentanyl to get an extra kick is now killing more and more people. Yeah, sure High School dropouts know how to figure out how much fentanyl to use to lace their drugs with. Well if you dance with the devil, you eventually will have to pay the piper and the only way to pay is with death.

He'd gotten involved with the drug business.  49 years later I still think about him when I read or hear these stories. I have a 16 year old grandson and it's a fear I have that he might make these types of mistakes. God keep everyone safe and give them the wisdom to make the right choices.

Content     : When I think of drug overdoses, I always picture down-and-out addicts who live on the street and have nothing to live for. It's hard to imagine how someone with wealth, security, and a comfortable life could fall victim to such a thing, but it happens all the time. I enjoy a little weed, and dabbled in psychedelics in high school as a kid, but never even had the slightest urge to try anthing stronger, so I'm here to tell about it.

Content     : Why do all of you racists assume she voted for Biden? Also everyone stop being ridiculous.  People in here complaining about 12 tacos for $25? What do you want free food?!? This is capitalism folks, and price increases have existed since I don't know, maybe the dawn of time! Remember when a gallon of milk was a quarter?  I have never seen so many people cry inflation outrage about not having money for Taco bell, which by the way still has a dollar menu! No one is forcing you to be content with your current wages, work harder get a better job that pays you more money. Isn't that what you're always complaining about?  People wanting hand outs? Well don't expect them from American corporations.

I rarely crave TB but there are things around or under 1.50 like the crispy taco. Chalupas are more but that's like two tacos together.   I like the pintos and cheese.  $2.50 is a little much but I like the sauce and cheese and make a meal out of one with some chips.  TB is still cheap.

Content     : It's so hilarious seeing the economic illiterates not understand inflation, how many we have and who is responsible. One-  is due to overconsumption which is done by consumers over spending with little stock made. Two- is prices set due to wanting to keep profit margins by corporations. Third- is due to the demand of that overconsumption helping corporations justify raising prices.  None of those things are on government. This country is economically illiterate and it's a disgrace considering it's a capitalist country. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

Content     : They've buried the Lede here. Taco Bell's prices are up and there's all sorts of angst. Comments are rife with "It's because you're paying $20/hr." "It's the Liberals fault'. The answer is in the article: "According to Nation‚Äôs Restaurant News, Taco Bell smashed a number of growth and sales records last year, leaving parent Yum Brands feeling good about their chances in 2024." Yum Brands owns KFC, Pizza Hut, and Taco Bell. Restaurant Brands International owns Burger King, Tim Hortons, and Popeyes. Darden Restaurants owns Olive Garden, LongHorn Steakhouse, Yard House, Ruth's Chris Steak House, Cheddar‚Äôs Scratch Kitchen, The Capital Grille, Seasons 52, Eddie V's and Bahama Breeze. Bloomin' Brands owns Outback Steakhouse, Carrabba's Italian Grill, Bonefish Grill, and Fleming's Prime Steakhouse.Anyone sense a pattern? 10 companies own 50 different brands. There's no real competition, people. Oh yes, a store here or there closes. Sometimes it's a chain. and that is often tied to the chain being bought in a leverage buyout by a bigger group. Recently, it was OMG inflation is at a 40 year high. But nary a peep about corporate profits being a a 70 year peak. Only now are studies coming out show that more than half of that 40 year increase was corporations raising their margins far above actual cost increases. They were using legitimate problems with supply to gouge Us.

Content     : It's BS.  DEFLECTING, but will probably work out for trump.  Ga recently passed a law that allows firing of DAs.  Senate Bill 92, established the Prosecuting Attorneys Qualifications Commission (PAQC). The PAQC will serve as a mechanism for getting rid of district attorneys and solicitors-general across Georgia, who the good ole boys  decide are not doing their constitutional and statutory duties the way the committee wants them done.  "Brine" Kemp the governor: "My No. 1 priority is public safety across our state," said Kemp "As hardworking law enforcement officers routinely put their lives on the line to investigate, confront, and arrest criminal offenders, I won't stand idly by as they're met with resistance from rogue or incompetent prosecutors who refuse to uphold the law.The bill establishes the following grounds for the removal or involuntary retirement of a district attorney or solicitor-general from office:‚ñ™Mental or physical incapacity that interferes with the performance of duties that is likely permanent;‚ñ™Willful misconduct in office;‚ñ™Willful and persistent failure to carry out statutory duties;‚ñ™Conviction of a crime involving moral turpitude;‚ñ™Conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice which brings the office into disrepute; or‚ñ™Knowingly authorizing or permitting an assistant district attorney or assistant solicitor-general to commit any of the aforementioned acts.By Fani and Wade.

Content     : NY Post Editors & Readers:Please give us the exact section number of Georgia law or the Georgia State Bar Rules of Professional Conduct regulating District Attorneys that Fani Willis or Nathan Wade have violated in a criminal manner...or even as a disbarable offense.The reason is that I've been a lawyer for only 45 years, and I spent most of the day reading Georgia law.  I can't find any Georgia law or Bar Rule either Willis or Wade have broken, or which even applies to their relationship.There is no law in Georgia barring sexual relationships outside of marriage.There is no law in Georgia barring unmarried people from having sexual relationships.There is no law in Georgia barring any of their 159 District Attorneys from having a sexual relationship with any of the D.A.'s employees or independent contractors.The only Bar Rule even remotely close says that a D.A. like Fani Willis can't criminally prosecute any clients of her lawyer-boyfriend.  That's not the case here.

Biden does not believe he has to play by the rules, therefore he uses his position to sell out to foreign entities. Pelosi does not have to play by the rules and gives her husband inside knowledge of stock market activities to profit from.  Newsom, Schummer, Nader, Schiff, all do the same thing.

Content     : Two grifters. Both will now have to recuse themselves from the trials thanks to the great legal work of Mike Roman‚Äôs attorney. The cases are severely tainted now and although they will not be tossed out, even the leftist media will have a hard time defending Willis. Instead of just answering questions about her taxpayer-paid lover Wade, she proclaimed her ‚Äúguilt‚Äù by fleeing to a Black church to play the race card. The last refuge of the coward is religion. Fani, you blew it. Hope Wade was worth it.

This is a microcosm for how Democrats work: they give to [name organization here: defense contractor, green energy company, Planned Parenthood], then that organization gives back to them in the form of campaign contributions. Got it? Now you know how they enrich themselves.

Content     : we are not allowed to comment on the man playing golf on the women's tour? why? there is maybe 1% of the population who are in favor of this, yet it keeps happening and we are not even able to TALK about it. really makes you wonder who's running the world, doesn't it? i was never a conspiracy nut, but there is obviously some very powerful person or persons who constantly get their way, and the rest of us don't matter at all.

That Fani Willis did not realize her case against Trump would expose EVERYTHING in itself shows how ignorant or stupid she is. Now she is delivering speeches blaming it all on racism. This whole case against Trump, the only one that is a state criminal case, not federal, and the only one that might have been completed before the election is now on the verge of complete collapse or dismissal because of Fani's incompetence. If you really want the gory details that the MSM is not reporting go read the online Atlanta Journal Constitution. It's free with no pay wall.

Having tried Rico cases, the idea of turning the prosecution of a 14 defendant case, with some of the most well-known people on the planet, who will undoubtedly have superior counsel, can only be decribed as a grossly incompetent decision.

It's painfully redundant and excruciatingly slow as her granddaughter adds zilch and her son is a distraction.   The biggest disappointment is reading Judge Judy anointed Nikki Haley who we know as the Dem posing as a Rep who loves wars and will soon be knocked off her perch to fade away.   Judge Judy seems blocked, living in a comfy little box. No empathy for what Americans are going thru now. Oblivious to everything around you and content to take in all the fake news from Joy Reid, The View, Rachel Maddow, Jake Tapper et al.....

Content     : I love Judge Judy. Many court shows since, and some are pretty good, but no one comes close to Judge Judy. She runs the show and knows a liar when she sees and hears one. I love it. Her granddaughter is smart, just like her grandmother. Her new show is just as good. I love the fact that she still does new shows. I've been totally entertained for years. To another 25 years Judge Judy!!

Content     : Huge fan who tread milled to 4 Judge Judy's per day for yrs until she revamped   her show to make her son/grandaughter rich w/a new unwatchable show. It's painfully redundant and excruciatingly slow as her granddaughter adds zilch and her son is a distraction.   The biggest disappointment is reading Judge Judy anointed Nikki Haley who we know as the Dem posing as a Rep who loves wars and will soon be knocked off her perch to fade away.   Judge Judy seems blocked, living in a comfy little box. No empathy for what Americans are going thru now. Oblivious to everything around you and content to take in all the fake news from Joy Reid, The View, Rachel Maddow, Jake Tapper et al.....

Content     : There is a huge opportunity on the horizon for an entrepreneur. Once the judge leaves this world and is laid to rest somewhere‚Ä¶and the location becomes known, there will likely be a steady stream of former litigants who were insulted, mistreated and otherwise wronged by her over the years. They will visit to express their displeasure however they see fit. A well-placed food truck should see steady business.

Not judging him on his lack of morality but on his overall accomplishments and mistakes I‚Äôd say he did as could a job as any president before him not named Carter. No disrespect intended.As a Republican I can honestly say that what has stained the soul of the Democrats is the foulness of the quasi to outright socialist elements that have been infiltrating the party‚Äôs ranks since the Obama administration came into power with little to nothing to show in the way of bettering this country!Now we have doddering old man fumbling his way through domestic and foreign policy leaving us a laughing stock to our allies snd enemies. Sadly, the alternative this November isn‚Äôt any better if Trump is re-elected. For the most part I like his policies but cannot abide by his rhetoric nor his leadership style.

Content     : It seems to me that the further Fetterman gets from the stroke he had the more his thinking has become more rational. Gone is the candidate that promised to empty the jails of murderers and handing out drugs to junkies and replaced by lucid thinking and away from the FAR FAR left. All this makes me think that the Democrats have cognitive brain issues without the excuse they are recovering from a stroke.

Content     : Biden or his puppet masters knowingly created open borders through the slick use of "humanitarian parole" - something to be used sparingly but now is passed out like candy, given to the majority who skip immigration procedure and just show up at the border. Where they are allowed in on "humanitarian parole" with a piece of paper telling them to schedule an appointment at a local immigration court. Which is a con game as these courts are booked months or years into the future. And some migrants who actually were seen in immigration court were coached to request an extension - because the longer in the U.S. the less likely to be deported, and most are cognizant of having no grounds for asylum. They are economic migrants. And as they wait they know to head to a city like NY or Chicago where the taxpayers will be forced to provide them with free housing, free food and free medical care. The obvious solution is to restrict humanitarian parole. But guess who is against restricting it? The Democrats. Who are counting on 5-10 million migrants ushered in during Biden's "presidency" who will be so grateful they will be Democratic voters. It's all a con game at the expense of American taxpayers.

Content     : Say what you want about Bill Clinton but he was the last true Democratic president we had. Not judging him on his lack of morality but on his overall accomplishments and mistakes I‚Äôd say he did as could a job as any president before him not named Carter. No disrespect intended.As a Republican I can honestly say that what has stained the soul of the Democrats is the foulness of the quasi to outright socialist elements that have been infiltrating the party‚Äôs ranks since the Obama administration came into power with little to nothing to show in the way of bettering this country!Now we have doddering old man fumbling his way through domestic and foreign policy leaving us a laughing stock to our allies snd enemies. Sadly, the alternative this November isn‚Äôt any better if Trump is re-elected. For the most part I like his policies but cannot abide by his rhetoric nor his leadership style.

And the only intelligent way to compare any of these so-called "solutions" is to perform and compare full, life-cycle analyses of emitted GHG for each so-called "solution." These analyses must include GHGs emitted during the mining and transportation of all materials, manufacturing, life-time usage and recycling of all involved components. Without these meaningfull GHG life-cycle comparisons to actually achieve the goal of reducing GHGs, all so-called "solutions" are nothing but smoke and mirrors fueling blind beliefs of the misled and misinformed agendas.

Content     : It only makes common sense that cheap or (free in many cases) renewable energy sources is the only way to go. It really means future energy independence as we could cut our foreign energy dependence by 90% needing less military investment and involvement to keep foreign oil flowing. We wouldn‚Äôt have to spend trillions to transport and refine trillions of gallons of foreign crude. Of course we would vastly reduce the carbon emissions that have warmed our planet to dangerous levels threatening fresh water supplies. As many drivers and homeowners have discovered renewable energy has saved them thousands of dollars. In short it is irresponsible to continue to support and invest in fossil fuels, the only people who truly benefit is big oil corporations and their shareholders. One last but important point a major contributor to the collapse of the British Empire in the 20th century was their continued reliance on coal because it was cheaper and more accessible than fossil fuels. So people wise up think a bit deeper and reject this foolish notion that fossil fuels are the future when they are clearly the past, so let‚Äôs not go backwards

Just to recap, Russia has:A hostile regime which loudly professes their intentions to remake the world order and dilute American influence and interests worldwide.Repeatedly flown dangerous maneuvers near American military aircraft in Syria and elsewhere, creating hazards to our men.Interfered in American elections (by their own admission) and tacitly supported hackers stealing funds from American internet users.Been listed by the EU as a state sponsor of terrorism.Repeatedly invaded its neighbors with land grab attempts and threatened our NATO allies.And yet, DJT and his band of MAGA Minions want to withdraw support from Ukraine and allow Putin to gain more power and influence. In light of all the above, you consider yourselves "patriots?" Interesting.

Batteries usually get excessively hot when drawing too much current. Why did the charger put out such a high amperage? How long was the battery charging? Was it drained so low it drew excessive amperage from the charger? Was the battery fully charged, and the charger didn't shut off, continuing to overcharge it? Did the battery have shorted cells?Yes, these batteries burn insanely hot, but no one says what starts the fires.

Content     : Forget the fires - the city needs to register these things, licensing them, and start promoting traffic safety. It‚Äôs getting very dangerous out there for pedestrians and normal bike riders with e-bikes everywhere in all directions. The cops need to begin ticketing the e-bikes  for traffic violations (I live in the EV and have never seen a single e-bike ticketed!). The guys riding them are constantly riding on sidewalks, against traffic, they often have no lights, they ride through red lights - and there are never consequences. NEVER. It‚Äôs ridiculous.

Content     : So what caused the battery to ignite? Was the charger putting out too much voltage or current? The battery probably ignited due to excessive heat. Batteries usually get excessively hot when drawing too much current. Why did the charger put out such a high amperage? How long was the battery charging? Was it drained so low it drew excessive amperage from the charger? Was the battery fully charged, and the charger didn't shut off, continuing to overcharge it? Did the battery have shorted cells?Yes, these batteries burn insanely hot, but no one says what starts the fires.

Content     : so let me understand this correctly.  You Mr Lolota a person who served in the military thinks trump is a great person? .  A person who said any person who became a POW in worthless because the got caught?  A great   person who had the audacity to have a curtain strung  across the fantail of the  McCain?  How do you think all of the personal felt on that ship that day.  A person who has absolutely no respect for the people killed in all wars. . And you think this is your best pick.  This is only the tip of the iceberg.  what a total disgrace your are to the military.

Content     : The people  want the security, prosperity  and pride  (in being American) that they experienced in Trump's first term . The Dems / RINOs agenda which favors the rich, traps the poor and destroys the middle class is being soundly rejected. And if Michelle Obama wants to run on that agenda, good luck. She'll lose and the Obama brand will be shattered.

Content     : The thing about that is all the local papers died. So you‚Äôll see the New York Post paper copies selling fast down in Delaware even way out in western PA. Not a perfect newspaper but I do give them credit for becoming way more of a national paper than one just geared for Long Island commuters like it always was historically.

Content     : Well, well, well‚Ä¶look who is already laying the groundwork for a presidential run in 2028. Or maybe sooner, if Biden falls apart.Fetterman is an interesting character.  He dresses like a slob so people find him approachable but also underestimate him (and because it‚Äôs comfortable) and he doesn‚Äôt really do what they expect in terms of policy positions.  Assuming his health issues are behind him (and they now seem to be), he could have a very interesting future ahead of him.

Content     : Fauci continues to be in denial about the origins of the virus, his role in creating the virus and the negative impact of many of his misguided policies at the height of the epidemic . Why? Because he can‚Äôt accept or come to grips with his role and the devastating consequences it had for not only our nation but the world.

Content     : The only issue with vaccines in this country is the right wing media, and individuals with a media presence stating that vaccines are a problem.  98% of medical professionals agree on how important they are.  Why do you think we have no measles problem in this country?  Millions of children used to die from measles‚Ä¶.now few kids do.  Why do you want to stop people from saving their families health?  You might as well make a wild claim that the 2020 election was stolen!

I did take the time to watch Fauci and His endless appearances on TV, and yes, he flip flopped many times, and how defensive he became when confronted by Rand Paul, who yes is a Doctor Himself, and might know a thing or two about Medicine, yes the weight of complaints comes down on him, Fauci, but the organizations behind him were just as Bad. WHO, for example CDC as well with their very nervous Spokesperson as well. Politics, even though people don‚Äôt want to hear it, played a Major role in the flip flopping, and widespread Misinformation, led to the loss of trust.

Content     : Back when I was in elementary school in the 60's, everyone got vaccines for stuff like polio during school. There were no permission slips for parents. Your class was brought to the gymnasium where a local doctor and nurse gave the vaccines. Our parents came through Great Depression and saw first hand what diseases like Polio, Scarlet Fever, Typhoid, Tuberculosis, and others did to whole families.   My best friends got Whopping Cough and were isolated at their grandfathers house by the health department.   Sadly things have changed and many of these diseases are making a comeback.

Content     : You can't put all the MMR thing on Fauci.  It's been a trend for many, many years for parents to avoid vaccinating their kids.  Many choose to home school and many choose private and religious schools in order to avoid vaccines.  I think they are insane but whatever and it is true that the illegals got nothin' but if your kid is vaccinated, they don't need to worry about it. My sister and I got Rubella when we were little bitty and we survived and only about 9 or 10,000 cases of measles has been reported in the US the past years and that's mostly thanks to vaccinations.   It's a crap shoot. It's your kid.

Their children, their choice, and Dr Jenny McCarthy said vaccinations caused autism. Apparently, before Trump was in charge, liberals didn't believe in science, they believed in Jenny McCarthy. And they also didn't believe in science during covid either since they rejected all scientific findings that didn't support their hysteria.

The author of this article did not include their medical degree but is quick to point fingers at the CDC with more PHD and medical Degrees than some hospitals.  The CDC recommends vaccines and society requests exemptions, so the diseases will never go away. For those who are wondering whether or not the masks are necessary for the next pandemic I suggest you don‚Äôt wear one and see where you sit. Vaccinations masks recommendations from the CDC are meant to help society not ruin it people who don‚Äôt vaccinate are ruining society. finally you may want to check out what Wuhan is up to because apparently they‚Äôve come up with a Covid like virus that could kill in eight days. Keep targeting the CDC and they may not be so willing to share advice when that one hits.

Content     : To blame the current measles outbreaks on Fauci is a gross distortion of reality. The roll-out of the Moderna and Pfizer mRNA vaccines against COVID-19 was unprecedented in terms of the speed with which the vaccines were developed, mass-produced and made available.  The Post ignores the effectiveness of these vaccines in limiting disease severity and saving countless lives.  Social distancing and masking were necessary inconveniences which greatly reduced the burden on already overwhelmed hospitals and their heroic staffs.    Fauci, a world-recognized expert in Virology and Immunology  who spent 5 decades building his reputation, is undeserving of your contempt.  If parents who chose not to have their children against Measles were confused b/c of their distrust of vaccines due to Fauci's alleged blunders with Covid-19, why didn't these parents discuss this with their Pediatrician, who undoubtedly would have strongly urged the vaccination? Or, do you also believe that Pediatricians who advise the tried and tested vaccines that have kept us all safe for decades are misguided?  If we had forgone vaccination, masks and social distancing, we'd have gotten to herd immunity for sure but the death toll would have been vastly greater than it has been and hospital ERs and ICUs would have been even more overwhelmed.  To state that Fauci is responsible for today's Measles outbreaks is to imply that medicine is an exact science.  It is not.

The reality is nobody knew at first if it was airborne or contact. I remember hearing about people washing their groceries in the dishwasher. It wasn't until months later that we were told that it was airborne. The people who were wanting kids back in school weren't taking account of kids with parents that had immune issues. There's a lot more of those people than most would expect. Then there were the families where both parents died leaving orphans.. Yeah.. that happened.This reminds me of Bill Mayer saying that he took one for the team while down playing the virus's severity. Trump and company's bungling of masks (everybody bidding on a box of masks) and making vaccines and masks political resulted in approximately a half million more deaths than were likely without all of the ignorance. We are number one in the world for deaths from covid because of Trump and his merry band of flying monkeys...

Content     : This article is supposed to be about a Measles outbreak, yet 5/7 of the article is deriding Fauci and the Covid response. The reason measles is making a come-back is because people stopped getting vaccinated for it. Same thing with Pertussis, which is making a come back and can be fatal to newborns (who usually contract it from their caregivers); for some reason, TDAP vaccine is also being refused. One should probably look more at the anti-vaxxer movement (which was around since BEFORE Covid) and look for answers there as to why we are seeing a resurgence of diseases. It isn't immigration, it isn't government-designed. It is because people have made conscious choices to not be vaccinated, and therefore are susceptible to infection. Cause meet Effect. It is called 'consequences'.

Content     : What a bunch of lies blaming Fauci! MAGA editors at NY Post blaming measles outbreaks on a man who hasn't been in office since 12/22. This outbreak was caused by anti-vax parents who didn't vaccinate their kids and then, when they got sick; continued to send them to daycare and school resulting in other children catching measles. If you want to blame anyone, blame Trump and his followers who denied the effectiveness and safety of the covid vaccine ( though he initially promoted it and took credit for it) resulting in fear mongering and anti-vax conspiracies. Fauci wasn't perfect but no one knew ANYTHING about Covid at 1st and Fauci changed recommendations as we learned about the disease.  Unlike Trump who continued to disparage the vaccine,  offered dangerous, unproven remedies and caused more deaths because people feared the vaccine. NY Post is owned by Rupert Murdoch who supports Trump so keep that in mind when reading about vaccines and the constant blame of anyone other than Trump. .

Handing someone a lab coat and a stethoscope doesn‚Äôt turn a reprobate into a saint if virtue is not part of her/his moral makeup. And whether it‚Äôs politics, the clergy, lawyers, auto mechanics, doctors or any other group there will be a percentage of deviant population who will engage in self-serving and   immoral if not outright illegal behavior. If you question the business aspects of medicine, there is a major move afoot to consolidate hospitals and clinics and doctors‚Äô practices and dentists and veterinarians within a larger corporate umbrella. The same has happened in the funeral home and cemetery business. Perhaps when we know it‚Äôs really time to worry is when we find hospital chains  buying crematoria as a smiling Bill Gates looks on.

Content     : Would someone with some fact based information explain why, if we had essentially ‚Äúeradicated‚Äù measles through an exhaustive vaccination program just a few years ago, would or should we be concerned about border hoppers exposing the General population to that specific disease? The same goes for polio. If you‚Äôre vaccinated against measles or already had it, shouldn‚Äôt you now be immunized against it?  That is the motivating theory behind vaccinations. So why exactly would you be worried - even if every illegal border crosser contracts the disease. I never understood the argument put forward by Fauci and the CDC that their ‚Äúhighly effective‚Äù shot which immunized the recipient against Covid still could be defeated by a non-believer who chose not to take it and who could infect the fully vaccinated person. You have to have a room temperature IQ to believe that. But if someone cares to explain it, I‚Äôm listening. And three years later I‚Äôm still waiting.

Try laying some blame at the doorstep of DJT, who poo-pooed Covid, said we had one case, and it would be gone soon, when he knew that was a lie.

Content     : This is one of the most uninformed editorials I have ever read. Dr Fauci has spent his lifetime arguing the benefits of vaccination against the anti-science anti-vax crowd, whose voice has been amplified only by the efficacy of those same vaccines, eradicaing those diseases to the point where formerly devastating measles (with blindness and death risks) and polio (with paralysis risk) were virtually eliminated. I have an older friend in a wheelchair because of childhood polio, he regularly finds himself in arguments with anti-vax folks who blame the not-yet-available polio vaccine he never had an opportunity to take for causing his polio and paralysis. This article must have been written by one of those same knuckleheads.

Content     : Personally, i dont care if you are pro or anti vax.  But let's be honest, pharma & govt knew the covid shot was not about limiting transmission but tried to sell it as such for as long as they could.The more important question is about big govt & mandates. Should govt be able to force you to get vaxxed?  What about "my body, my choice"?  You can terminate the life of an unborn human being at your own choice but you can't refuse a vax? That sounds hypocritical.  And in most cases if you don't take a vax you're primarily only putting yourself at risk. Yes, I get a risk to pregnant women but that is not like a massive pandemic risk such as covid.  And if I'm vaxed & your not, I won't get measles or mumps from you. So no risk.  So is it really OK to give govt the power to take that personal freedom away from the public?  I'm not so sure. But just my opinion.

Content     : The author should be placing blame on the right wing extremists and various anti-vaccine movements that have been spreading disinformation about vaccines, including MMR, for years now. The Trump administration gave them credence and support, as did a number of prominent Republican politicians. They also worked to undermine trust in the FDA and government in general. No wonder more people are opting out of vaccines, especially since the predominant reason given for not wanting their kids vaccinated is their Christian faith. When I attended public school, many years ago, the rule was simple - no vaccination, no admission to school, no exception. Vaccines were even administered by a local doctor in the elementary school classrooms. We all lined up for shots.

Content     : The only issue with vaccines in this country is the right wing media, and individuals with a media presence stating that vaccines are a problem.  98% of medical professionals agree on how important they are.  Why do you think we have no measles problem in this country?  Millions of children used to die from measles‚Ä¶.now few kids do.  Why do you want to stop people from saving their families health?  You might as well make a wild claim that the 2020 election was stolen!

Content     : The media and You Tube podcasters have made more of this than it really should be.  I believe the Mets are prepared to allow Alonso's FA to play out and find his true market value - as the Yankees did with Judge and the Mets have done previously with Nimmo.  When you have the wealthiest owner in sports, who can match or outbid any offer, you can afford to take these gambles.  No, the Mets DO NOT NEED to trade Alonso now, OR at the trade deadline.  If Uncle Steve wants Pete in NY, he will be here.

Content     : In an analytic age where contact hitters aren't valued, strikeouts don't matter, and the love affair with the long ball is cherished, Alonso is not yet signed to a long-term, 8-year extension. He is one of the premier home run hitters in the league, hits a 100RBIs, plays a better-than-average first base, is a team leader, loves NY, and can easily be transitioned over to DH. It baffles me. It seems both the Yankees and Mets are always willing to overpay for other people's players, but for their own, they tighten the purse strings. What's the hang-up? His WAR isn't high enough... ridiculous.

Mets should have signed him up when they gave McNeil his bag, before Boras came in. Now ? It will cost more, but they need him. He is a fan favorite and has improved very much at 1B defensively. If Chapman got $168M over 8, perhaps Mets can keep Pete for 6 years $150M ? That would make him 35 at the end of that deal and still allow him to get another contract if he remains productive. Boras will surely want more, but that's Mets fault for letting it get here.

Content     : At some point, Stearns/Cohen need to have the courage of their convictions regardless of fan reaction. The question here is not - do they want Alonso on the Mets, the question is - do you want him on the Mets at $280-300MM over 8-10 years? If they believe that they'd be better off getting a high end prospect or two for his 2024, then I would say only this  - DO it before the season begins. Every day that goes off the 2024 schedule means less value that comes back. If you're trading him, trade him, if you plan to sign him, then sign him. Just don't wait until July to trade him - or pull a Reyes and let him play the season then walk away with no return. Make a decision and execute on it before value drops.

Well the truth be told if he really cared about us the fans, our team, his teammates, and our city - then he never would have signed up with Scott "The Avenging Angel" Boras.   Pete knows Boras is the DEVIL selling his clients down the river to the HIGHEST BIDDER!  Pete's a good guy, beloved by all Mets fans.  As long as his demands were reasonable he would have already received a 5 year extension.  With Boras in the picture you already know the bidding starts at $350 million for 10 years.  Bye-Bye Pete as the last 5 years of that deal, he'll look like Stanton, perhaps even worse. This is what's wrong with baseball today.  The fans be damned.  Pete opted for the money and got in bed with the Devil.  He's as good as gone.

Content     : You never get fair value,  the pieces never will equate to the whole. How many of the five the Mets got for Seaver ever helped the Mets win anything? None. Pete‚Äôs not Seaver, but Stearns and cohen will quickly find out how the fans can make your lives if you decide to cheap out. Those empty over priced seats will be quite barren. The five year promise will be ten plus in a heart beat.

Content     : Joel, first of all, it‚Äôs the fans who pay the bills, so the fans‚Äô collective opinions should matter in such decisions.All the opinions put forth here pretend to be rationally based but really reflect their owners‚Äô biases - a kind of community Rorschach test.  (Including mine).  Bottom line for me, I enjoy Pete‚Äôs presence on the club, and would love to see him re-signed at a market price.  How he continues to perform will determine if the decision helps or hurts the team long-term, but either way it will not be determinative.  Stearns‚Äô overall management of Steve‚Äôs allocated resources will determine how the Mets do over the next decade.  No one should doubt the brains or resolve of those two guys, so optimism should be the dominant feeling - Go Mets!

Content     : I really like Pete but honestly? They probably should trade him this season. You have to know Boras will shoot for a Judge like contract and it‚Äôs just not worth it... any contract of ten years will be a contract of diminishing returns. These are the kinds of contracts teams sign and then end up regretting because it ties them up and keeps them from making the moves they need to make down the road. Again, I like Alonso and would love it if he stayed just not at any price. 6 years at 38mil a year with an option for a 7th year based on performance. Anything more than that would be throwing money away.

The guys they are waiting for in 2025 to come up are young so it‚Äôs going to be a pretty young team. Besides if Soto becomes a free agent next year, I‚Äôd rather have him

Content     : Aaron Judge not only hit 63 home runs, he did it while batting .311. The reason the Mets are not trading Alonso is likely that there is a limited market for a first baseman who batted .217 last year and is a walk year - and oh, yeah, he is represented by Scott Boras. Number of times a GM has said, "giving that mega deal to a Scott Boras client was the key to our winning the World Series" - ZERO. I don't think any team is offering a #1-3 starter or a couple of highly rated prospects to rent Alonso for a year.

Content     : So the question is what do the Mets, pay a 1st baseman that clearly is not anywhere as good as either Freeman and Olson who are earning between 22 and 27 million a year in their contracts.Pete hits HR's and drives in runsHis Slug, OPS, OBP, AVG are below par.He hit .217 last year with only 21 doubles and grounded into 17 DP'sHe can't throw to second base on simple bunt plays or when trying to turn a double play. He can't throw accurately to home plate either.Most likely he will be a fulltime DH within a couple of years, playing 1st base sporadically only to provide relief for whoever is the starting 1st baseman.I recommend trading him at the deadline if the Mets are not in it for a couple of high level prospectsThen offer him a FA contract after the season in the ballpark of 5/6 years for 110-132 million (22 million AAV)If he can get more years and more money somewhere else, good luck to himMets will at least have a couple of prospects

Last year was hr or bust with Pete. He goes ice cold for long stretches where all he does is strike out on pitches out of the zone. Especially when all is needed is a sac fly. I think he would have more impact if he had a few less hrs. If he could minimize the cold streaks, the k's, hit around 250 and hit more doubles and get sac flys he would be a better all around player.

Another words, did he hit the bulk of them in key spots, or when the season was effectively over. I believe the latter is true. He‚Äôs certainly worth signing, but not for greater than Freddie F money and certainly not for 8 years. The team needs to set all emotion aside.

If you let the season start he is therefore traded, in season, so if you decide to sign him next off season, it won‚Äôt cost draft compensation They‚Äôre not winning anything next year anyway so it makes no difference what place they end up in. He is more valuable RIGHT NOW. Someone needs a 40 homer 110 rbi 1st baseman/DH. Get some damn pitching for him. Sign Rhys Hoskins to play first for 2 years. It won‚Äôt make a difference in games lost or won. Rhys would be a fill in. This way you get something for the farm, and then if you really want him you can sign him next off season.

Content     : The question isn't whether Alonso would have been traded by now if not for the fans. The question is whether he will decide to stay because of the city and it's fans. The biggest mistake in my mind that Stearns has thus far made, besides letting Gregg Counsell play him like a dime store banjo, was the way he unceremoniously dismissed Buck Showalter without considering the repercussions from some of his core players. It was a poor miscalculation. Alonso dialed up Mr. Boras the next day. He was miffed. That's a bell Stearns cannot un-ring. To me it's 50-50 Pete stays, and that's on Stearns, not the fans.

Content     : The Mets look like they are throwing away the 2024 season. The not willing to sign the very affordable Japanese pitcher who went to the Cubs is the big sign of this. If they get a real DH to protect Alonso, he'll have a monster year and they won't be able to sign him for 2025 and onward as he's not worth $40M/year. With no lineup protection (and I do like the baby Mets, but none of the 3 are worthy of batting 5th), Alonso can duplicate his 2021 season, making him affordable to resign and have the Mets go all out in 2025.That's the only reason I can think of for not signing a DH, even if it's only for one year.

Content     : It seems that the Mets' management team is in a lose-lose situation right now (as long as we still think spending too much money is a loss). If Alonso has a good year, the Mets will then have to outbid several other teams just to keep him. If he has a bad year, they will probably let him walk. In either case, they may not have Alonso in 2025. Since the Mets seem to be focusing on seasons beyond this upcoming one, you almost have to wonder if they are hoping Alonso does not do very well in 2024. They probably figure the fans would be okay with losing him at that point. In my opinion, if you believe in him, you sign him now. Otherwise trade him and deal with the fallout. The only question is, if you trade him, who do you get (realistically) in return?

Content     : Pete IS the NY Mets. I, and many I know, watch games to see his at-bats. He has and will carry the team single-handedly for weeks or months. He was plunked repeatedly last season, with no response from their staff (which is why I'm happy gun-shy Buck is gone). As a result he played injured, accounting for his dismal BA. But Pete is a one-man wrecking crew any team would love to have. And true Met fans love him, and in no way, shape or form EVER want to see him traded. It's absolutely absurd to even consider it.

Content     : Pete will get every bit of 27-32 mil per year for at least 6 years. Mets should offer 180 million for 6 with a 7th year team option at 30 or 5 million buy out for 185 guaranteed for 6 and give him a third year opt -out. Done. The peripheals for Pete in New York get him at least another 10 mil per year on the side. If he does not take that and Mets are out in July, Buh Bye to the Bear. Judge is a .282 hitter and hits as many or more homers and can play CF or RF. That 40 mil per year and captainship justify the outrageous salary in the market. Pete is a .250 life time hitter the 30 point deficit to Judge and postional value deficit to Judge are real. Perhaps the Mets think all that money should go to SOTO next year and then some, and move Vientos over there on the cheap thus playing the younger stiffs this year? Met fans that cannot fathom why they did not sign him earlier. Model the Braves, not the Dodgers please. The team that kicks our Met fannies year after year.

Content     : Alonso is not a Stearns type player.  Although he tried to trade for him while with the Brewers he was never going to pay for him in Milwaukee and not in New York with the Mets.  Alonso goes against every rule in Analytics and checks every box of a fan hungry owner with money.  The problem is that Cohen brought Stearns in to guard him against himself.  This is a classic case where Stearns needs to reel in Cohen and he will.  Sorry Met Fans but a Boras big bodied home run hitting client will get the most money and it will not be with a Stearns-run-team.

(You think Michael Conforto regrets not signing the deal the Mets offered him a few years ago) It puts the Mets in a tough place. They should probably trade him if they can get good value or just keep him at this point. Let's see how the season goes.

Content     : How long have the Mets been in control of Alonso's earnings? His entire career, or since they signed him. And now, when he's a pending free agent on the precipice of making  his own deal with any team, suddenly faced with having to pay him his due, they have media pundits carrying their water, questioning  his actual value. It's a real question for the Mets. But what do you value when you don't win?  This is the history of the Mets. Pete may not be Tom Seaver, The Franchise, but club management always undervalued Seaver. And they documented that by letting  him escape contract control multiple times. That was just incompetence.So I say this with confidence: this franchise isn't about winning, it's about putting a semi-competitive, marketable, financially controllable team on the field. And whether it has likable guys who produce is great but it doesn't impact whatever sustainability mission drives this club. So, this is the Mets FO conundrum,  not the fans. The fans are sold on Pete. We know he isn't a perfect player. May not be the best first baseman, highest average hitter, but he creates excitement, anticipation, the prospect of hitting a homer in any at bat like no Met ever, who, like Seaver always delivered the anticipation of great success even when he fell short.

Content     : Mets fans, push away from the mirror, trade this 30 year old dude and mold your team for the better for the next ten years at multiple positions for less money. Your team is not one player away, and the one you want to hold on to is not Judge. Judge makes the Yankees trash look and play so much better when he's in the lineup, lozo does not have that affect. It's hard, but push this bird out the nest and make room for the young chicks that will be around once you are ready to really compete. Study the WORLD CHAMPION Texas Rangers. 7 starters are in arbitration or rookies. They won't have to pay these guys for at least 3 more years. Texas only has three huge contacts, two are MVP finalists and the other has been recognized as the best pitcher in baseball. That's how its done folks.

I believe the Mets are prepared to allow Alonso's FA to play out and find his true market value - as the Yankees did with Judge and the Mets have done previously with Nimmo.  When you have the wealthiest owner in sports, who can match or outbid any offer, you can afford to take these gambles.  No, the Mets DO NOT NEED to trade Alonso now, OR at the trade deadline.  If Uncle Steve wants Pete in NY, he will be here.

Content     : In an analytic age where contact hitters aren't valued, strikeouts don't matter, and the love affair with the long ball is cherished, Alonso is not yet signed to a long-term, 8-year extension. He is one of the premier home run hitters in the league, hits a 100RBIs, plays a better-than-average first base, is a team leader, loves NY, and can easily be transitioned over to DH. It baffles me. It seems both the Yankees and Mets are always willing to overpay for other people's players, but for their own, they tighten the purse strings. What's the hang-up? His WAR isn't high enough... ridiculous.

Mets should have signed him up when they gave McNeil his bag, before Boras came in. Now ? It will cost more, but they need him. He is a fan favorite and has improved very much at 1B defensively. If Chapman got $168M over 8, perhaps Mets can keep Pete for 6 years $150M ? That would make him 35 at the end of that deal and still allow him to get another contract if he remains productive. Boras will surely want more, but that's Mets fault for letting it get here.

Content     : First off, it is not ‚ÄúTravis Kelce‚Äôs Chiefs‚Äù, for crying out loud.  I can‚Äôt believe you forced me to say that. Second, I like you Bills fans. You wasted no time on pointing out the major flaw that is referred to as that Taylor woman.  So, Bills 1, Chiefs 0.  But we will see about that final score soon.

Content     : Maybe he should get up before 10am. Second time now he's missed a phone call that he shouldn't have, before reading about something in the press. First time? When the Queen was on her death bed. He's been out of the family for almost 4 years. They really didn't even need to notify him in advance. I noticed there isn't much time on the news of the King and Harry either. Most of it is once again, dredging up the whole 'aviation award' business. Must have needed a lot of filler for this one.

Content     : I don‚Äôt know why they ask Harold‚Äôs reps when the person who didn‚Äôt receive the news obviously gave this information. Why should he be informed? It‚Äôs not like he has sent any well wishes and don‚Äôt give me that ‚Äòhow do you know they didn‚Äôt?‚Äô because the Harkles never do a nice gesture without telling the tabloids for credit. Just like the birthday call that clearly never happened. Harry knew his grandfather was dying he and his wife did the Oprah interview and when it was asked to be pushed back they accused the Royals of trying to silence them along with false racism allegations when Philip was dying. Wasn‚Äôt it police who informed Harry Philip died? The entire family made the effort to spend at least some of their holidays at Balmoral when they all knew QE had bone cancer and Megs only let the kids see her ONCE when they were trying to negotiate Netflix content of ‚ÄòBetty meeting QE‚Äô and Jubilee inclusion on the balcony. As soon as they didn‚Äôt get what they wanted they left without saying goodbye when the Queen was waiting with a cake for Betty‚Äôs birthday. There is no obligation or reason to inform Harry of any Royal family member‚Äôs illnesses or events. He is not apart of the family and doesn‚Äôt deserve to know because he and his first wife don‚Äôt care.  They tend to only care about someone when they‚Äôre dead.

Secondly, it‚Äôs convenient how all these articles keep leaving out the middle of Harry‚Äôs insulting, demeaning and rude remarks to accomplished A lister John Travolta, then he literally shooed him away.

Neither claim was true.Trump rejected the idea of the visit because he feared his hair would become disheveled in the rain, and because he did not believe it important to honor American war dead, according to four people with firsthand knowledge of the discussion that day. In a conversation with senior staff members on the morning of the scheduled visit, Trump said, ‚ÄúWhy should I go to that cemetery? It‚Äôs filled with losers.‚Äù In a separate conversation on the same trip, Trump referred to the more than 1,800 marines who lost their lives at Belleau Wood as ‚Äúsuckers‚Äù for getting killed.

The five U.S. senators were accused of trying to pressure federal thrift regulators to back off their political benefactor Keating, whose Lincoln Savings & Loan would collapse during the savings-and-loan crisis at a cost of $3.4 billion to taxpayers. At the time, Keating was an influential and larger-than-life business figure in Arizona and he generously contributed campaign cash to his favorite politicians. Some 23,000 Lincoln bondholders were defrauded and many investors lost their life savings.

It‚Äôs even more popular now.Roughly three-in-five Americans like the 2010 health care law, even more than when Trump and Republicans in Congress came to the brink of wiping it out. And some of the Affordable Care Act‚Äôs better-known provisions ‚Äî like protections for preexisting health conditions ‚Äî engender even greater support.

Content     : When President Donald Trump canceled a visit to the Aisne-Marne American Cemetery near Paris in 2018, he blamed rain for the last-minute decision, saying that ‚Äúthe helicopter couldn‚Äôt fly‚Äù and that the Secret Service wouldn‚Äôt drive him there. Neither claim was true.Trump rejected the idea of the visit because he feared his hair would become disheveled in the rain, and because he did not believe it important to honor American war dead, according to four people with firsthand knowledge of the discussion that day. In a conversation with senior staff members on the morning of the scheduled visit, Trump said, ‚ÄúWhy should I go to that cemetery? It‚Äôs filled with losers.‚Äù In a separate conversation on the same trip, Trump referred to the more than 1,800 marines who lost their lives at Belleau Wood as ‚Äúsuckers‚Äù for getting killed.

Very much like the NFL keeping players who beat their partner‚Äôs and children. Also, this isn‚Äôt about Girl Dad‚Äôs bonding with their daughters, either. Tony Dungy was making a statement and not a disparaging one either, it was an observation. The powers that be running the NFL are over the moon that Taylor is with Travis, because she is bringing ratings (at least to the Chiefs games). Someone is telling the camera operator‚Äôs to have their cameras on Taylor for every huddle, snap, fumble and touchdown. There are many commentators who are practically wetting themselves when they see Taylor and then there are the ones who are like, ‚ÄúGuys we‚Äôre here for football, not talk about who the players are dating‚Äù, which I agree with the latter. But I also love Taylor Swift (not a Swifty by any means - I don‚Äôt threaten people) and hopefully she found her guy. I do believe the powers that be are laying off with the showing of TS, but this is what keeps the general news in business.

I imagine even today, a lot of kids watch what their parents watch. That's how the next generation of NFL Fans are born.As for Taylor Swift....ENOUGH Already! I'm rooting against the Chiefs just so I don't have to see one more minute of Swift this season. Hopefully by next year she'll be dating someone else.... Like maybe a death row inmate she's pen pals with!

Content     : Taylor Swift personifies how women want to be viewed these days- the center of attention/lead character but like most people- it's all empty and meaningless without a family, but most will not hit the half court buzzer beater in their 30's- most in fact have already fouled out

Content     : Nine year old boys aren't all that interested in sitting in front of a TV for the 3+ hours it takes to watch an NFL game.  I know I wasn't, and I loved football--playing it, not watching it.  I played from 4th grade through high school.  I only started watching it when my playing days were through.My daughter is 27 and an original Swiftie.  We've been watching football together since long before Taylor arrived to the NFL scene  But we watch college football, not the NFL.  I'm a Bama grad and she went to Georgia. It's been fun.  The daughter doesn't run to the TV whenever KC is playing just to see Swift, but she did pay $200 for a concert ticket and about $500 for a flight to see Taylor on her Eras tour.

Content     : The problem is stemming from the NFL‚Äôs side. They are having an internal issue with Taylor Swift. This is not a Taylor Swift problem this is a NFL problem. Very much like the NFL keeping players who beat their partner‚Äôs and children. Also, this isn‚Äôt about Girl Dad‚Äôs bonding with their daughters, either. Tony Dungy was making a statement and not a disparaging one either, it was an observation. The powers that be running the NFL are over the moon that Taylor is with Travis, because she is bringing ratings (at least to the Chiefs games). Someone is telling the camera operator‚Äôs to have their cameras on Taylor for every huddle, snap, fumble and touchdown. There are many commentators who are practically wetting themselves when they see Taylor and then there are the ones who are like, ‚ÄúGuys we‚Äôre here for football, not talk about who the players are dating‚Äù, which I agree with the latter. But I also love Taylor Swift (not a Swifty by any means - I don‚Äôt threaten people) and hopefully she found her guy. I do believe the powers that be are laying off with the showing of TS, but this is what keeps the general news in business. It‚Äôs not a problem if you keep turning it into a problem, but let‚Äôs get back to football!

Content     : There is no funding at home because it is a totalitarian Marxist society where property ownership is discouraged unless one has enough social credits to own something. Why would any rational person invest under those circumstances? Better to hide wealth overseas. Yet, we have our own global utopians, in government and business, who believe that investing in China will somehow change the Marxist CCP that controls all things in China. More than likely, they will use their favorable trade status, capital and technology to form a noose to hang us with. Such people need to face charges of treason.

Content     : Even after IZ has ex spelled the Ab's who occupy southern Lebanon, the Ab's who occupy the land in the northeast (e.g. Damascus) will continue to try to destroy IZ. For instance, reports are that IZ is currently in negotiations to move Hezbollah back across the Litani River. But the Ab's already keep their most advanced missiles in the north (pointed south).First things first.After IZ has pushed the Ab's out of the Promised Land, the rest of the countries occupied by Ab's (e.g. Morocco) will recognize their own diminished situations and take the cue to free themselves from the Ab colonial yoke.Once the ~300M Ab occupiers (implacable though they may be) have been restored to their homeland, IZ can think about how to end the gee hod once and for all.

My guess Israel intelligence told the prime minister and he ignored their advice.  A few trained US Seals and Israel commandos and most likely the issue is resolved.

It should be obvious to all what Israeli's insidious objectives are: to drive the Palestinian people back into the stone age who will barely be able to exists among the rubble that will be Gaza. Today, the UN Sec reiterated again that the world organization will work for the establishment of a two-state Palestine, one Palestinian and the other Israeli based on the 1967 borders.  Regardless of how much Bibi Netanyahu howls and spits, he has to face the fact that he does not rule the world. Sure, Bibi may think that he rules America, which may be true. But that is all he rules outside of Israel.

In a democratic country such as ours, we are supposed to enjoy the fruits of a free market system, not one controlled by the Feds who control the interest rates, artificially. The Federal government has created this chaos, been doing this many years. The divide between the low income and wealthiest 1% has only widened with the middle being squeezed out of existence.I could insert my thesis here but this is neither the place nor time.

Content     : OMG  there exists plenty of apartments (housing), one just needs to have an annual income of 1M or more. It‚Äôs pricing . In a democratic country such as ours, we are supposed to enjoy the fruits of a free market system, not one controlled by the Feds who control the interest rates, artificially. The Federal government has created this chaos, been doing this many years. The divide between the low income and wealthiest 1% has only widened with the middle being squeezed out of existence.I could insert my thesis here but this is neither the place nor time. Unfortunately the political heads have the IQs of a rat, they can only run in a wheel over, over and over never understanding they achieve nothing.

Democrats must learn the hard way what socialism means. Republican Giuliani¬†restored law and¬†order to New York. Over the last 12 years, the Democrats have destroyed New York.

Content     : And where will you build these "tiny homes"? There is no room in nyc. The real way to solve the problem is to get investors out of the housing market and start deporting those that don't belong here. When you do these two things, you'll see housing prices go somewhat "back to normal".

Content     : I'm surprised that Hochul is smart enough to realize that destroying the suburbs by building soul-crushing low income housing (how well did "urban renewal" work out?) is a political loser. Not being able to micromanage your choice of neighborhoods must be a blow to her pandering "look at me - I'm a progressive too" political portfolio.  Anybody who wants to live near a multifamily building is free to move where they already exist ... Good luck with that, comrades; just don't poison our neighborhoods with your culture of crime and failure.

Content     : Subsidized housing represents a vast portion of the Democrat's voter base. Not a single new apartment building need be constructed due to the overwhelming glut of commercial real estate that's about to go into default. But Hochul is loath to consider this as a solution to housing the ahem, "less fortunate" as we all know what will happen to those areas that have the only large corporations left that haven't yet fled to more tax friendly states. This would be all it takes for a massive corporate flight from New York City.

Content     : A common tactic of the Israeli spin machine is to conflate valid criticism of Israel‚Äôs policies with antisemitism. This is a blatant attempt to silence criticism and carry on with impunity their inhumane treatment of the Palestinians, which includes oppression, apartheid, land theft, false imprisonment and now, genocide in Gaza.This ploy of accusing any valid criticism of Israel, as being an act of antisemitism is disingenuous and ineffective.The whole world knows that Israel is the oppressor. Israel is treating the Palestinians like the Nazis treated the Jews.

Now we are engaged in a national debate, testing whether that nation, or any nation so conceived, and so dedicated, can long endure. Soon we will decide our own fate. It is altogether fitting and proper that we do so for this is a testament to our liberty. But we cannot properly decide our fate without reflecting on the men and women who have gone before us ‚Äî who have made our freedom to choose our destiny possible. Let us then be dedicated to the unfinished work that lies ahead. Let us take increased devotion to the cause for which our forefathers gave their full measure of devotion.¬† And let us now highly resolve that they shall not have died in vain‚Äîthat this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom, and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.

The U.S. education system is a fail and yet most college students will pay and be financially burdened though out their lives for education that is influenced by woke professors and Hamas supporting lunatics. Yet we have students  who want to deny history by taking down confederate statues as if American history never existed. Don‚Äôt get me started about math either. Let‚Äôs face it, we are lazy, fat and ignorant about the world outside our bubble. Traveling from midtown to Washington heights does not mean you‚Äôre getting first hand experience of the world. I studied in London for 4 years and some of the English are quite self entitled. Germany is the worst. However, most students at the school where very wealthy and their parents would often pay the professors to give their children passing grades.. so I would also hope this chump would make a video and elaborate on that.

Sadly, they often know nothing about American history as well. I was once explaining that Jane Austen was born in the year before the America Revolution. Blank looks. "You know, the Revolution?" Nothing. I tried again. "A contemporary of Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson...?" More blank looks. "George Washington??? "  Furrowed brows and some glimmer of recognition. This English kid isn't wrong.

BTW taxpayers you are paying for his college and all the other foreign students, that is why the colleges prefer them over US students, the money is guaranteed.

It's gone in exchange for wokeness and leftist socialist indoctrination.    The future of this country is doomed.    At my age I'll be dead before that happens.

I left the UK 25 years ago and have never looked back, but the American higher education system is a complete joke, especially these days, as evidenced by recent events at Harvard and other propaganda mills.

I took my children out of public school in 2012, and we homeschooled one with Abekka Academy and put the other into private Catholic school. They both have a far better education than their public educated peers and we live in an excellent school district in western MA. Common Core was the swan song of demise for the education our family values.

Content     : It's embarrassing how poorly educated the typical American student is. The basics are just not there. History, geography, basic science, civics...I have run in to college graduates who don't know how many ounces make a pound. How many feet are in a yard. How many feet (roughly) equal 1 meter. Don't know basic history. Couldn't tell you when the Civil War was fought or name 3 Union Generals. or 5 major battles for that matter.I recently had a discussion about Israel with a college grad and she went on and on about how oppressed the Palestinians were. Yet when asked, she had no clue where Israel was. Were theWest Bank was, where the Gaza strip was located. She couldn't even tell me what two bodies of water were connected by the Suez Canal.High school students are not prepared for college but it doesn't matter. Many colleges are just indoctrination centers. There are issued talking points and narratives. Critical thinking skills, critical analysis skills, and writing skills are just not there.

Her ability as a trained professional with 15 years plus of experience is able to recognize irregularities that you can't. So, how can one claim that she's wrong or right until all the facts are presented and considered?

Content     : Many clinics and hospitals in the veterinary industry do not require technicians to be licensed and ultimately it's up to the doctors on shift to be responsible for whatever drugs, especially controlled drugs, are being drawn up and given. Period. If a technician made that mistake they should have been let go because that's is a big mistake but it ultimately falls on the doctor on shift. PERIOD. Probably only said something because she realized it was her job on the line. She knew signing up to work for a clinic like that whether their policy was to require them to be licensed or not as technicians and she should have known what that could have entailed after 15 years of being in the industry. Sounds to me like she's trying to make a stink because messed up. Period.

Content     : This allegation seems extremely out of character for him and the establishment. On two occasions, with different pets, I experienced nothing but empathy, top tier care, kindness and warmth. After spending over 7 days on separate occasions, the staff only expressed words of regard and thanks towards Infernuso. They all accommodate the pet parent and enhance the experience by allowing the parent to interact with the patient while under their care. From hugs, tears and breaking bread, Infernuso and staff go above and beyond with treatment and an exemplary customer experience.

I gave him some food...he would come about 2 feet to me, but no closer.I can't understand how people could be so unkind to a defenseless animal.  I truly don't get it.  In the case of this man, I imagine he had a good relationship with his pup.  It is good to see stories like this, because at times...I sometimes lose faith in humanity.

I will get a drivers license and will be able to fly without ID. Never thought it was possible to walk into a store take what you want not pay and never get arrested. America is a great country and I don't have to do a thing to get all the free stuff. THANK YOU THANK YOU American taxpayers

They had a little kick-n go scooter, and they were speaking only fluent Spanish. They had lanyards around their necks with their names printed on cards. They were very cute and seemed happy. Two little boys surging like the 20 degree temps in NYC on their scooter in the middle of a very congested theater district. I don‚Äôt know, I know a lot of people on this board are against the immigrants, but they are here for right now, so what do we do with them? These little kids were cute, and my heart was sort of wamed by them, but their parents may not be quite so cute. But what to do with the parents of the cute kids? Thats the question. Too bad they can‚Äôt have their paper work processed quicker so that they could get jobs more quickly and be assimilated into our society much quicker. Also, maybe send them to some less populated red states to ease the burden on the sanctuary cities? Now I know the red states don‚Äôt want them, that‚Äôs part of the problem. But why don‚Äôt some of these immigrants try and go to less populated states like North Dakota and Wyoming and try and get jobs out there ?

Content     : There are several aspects to this issue. #1 We need immigrants to fill critical jobs in Technology, Medicine, and more. #2 We already have an immigration system that works kindof, the biggest problem is that it's set at 50,000 a year. #3 This needs to be revamped to acquire the right people, This could include, farm workers, landscape and other needed positions. $4 This swarm of people at the the border is illegal and immoral because we re not set up to take so many unemployed, ill and dangerous people.  In a way these individuals want a better place to live and work, Illegal immigration costs each American taxpayer $1,156 per year ($957 after factoring in taxes paid by illegal aliens).Each illegal alien or U.S.-born child of illegal aliens costs the U.S. $8,776 annually.Evidence shows that tax payments by illegal aliens cover only around a sixth of the costs they create at all levels in this country.A large percentage of illegal aliens who work in the underground economy frequently avoid paying any income tax at¬†all.The govt states we have very low unemployment but these individuals are not included.

Content     : Biden has turned NY into a filty place. More companies and people will leave and the downward spiral will get into high gear. Why did people in NYC vote to be a sanctuary city?  How are New Yorker's going to pay for this mess?  There are more coming because Texas and Arizona are full of migrants.

It‚Äôs hard to find a bathroom in Manhattan without being forced to buy something from a venue. Where do you think people go to relieve themselves? The only difference between that toilet bowl and the common areas of the city is that you can the see disaster while the other is nearly invisible since most people do their deed on the ground and away from eyes.

Content     : The Biden Administration  this. They allowed all the migrants into sanctuary cities (I think ours was the first), and did not have a plan for what might happen if more than what they thought would flood the US came in. None of these people were vetted for possible viruses, or diseases  they were bringing into our country, how New Yorkers and citizens in other states would be affected and infected. Programs were cut, children were forced to go to remote learning for one day, while migrants slept in their gymnasium,  and the elderly split up and sent to different nursing homes while the one they were living in was used to house migrants, and the crime they brought with them (fighting in the streets and killing each other). Now our cherished communities are being used as public bathrooms. They are also going out at night, using their children, to go door to door waking up residents at all hours to ask for money. They came into our cities, and should've been held to the same standards as its citizens. Especially, when it comes to their children. CPS would have a truckload of cases, on top of what it already has, to deal with them. As a matter of fact, the children who are citizens would fall deeper into the pile where they are forgotten, leaving them in the hands of cruel parents. If they are being sheltered, they need to have a curfew on them, just like the natural citizens. I was homeless with my son nearly 30 years ago, and we had a curfew of 6pm.

Those same Democrats you've voted to control the Assembly for 60 years? Do you remember why you supported this? And don't say you don't because an overwhelming amount of NYC voters vote Democrat every single year. Do you remember why Koch and company, and you voters went along with it? Because "Elected officials wanted to make sure asylum seekers would not be afraid to report crimes or enroll their kids in public school and get medical care over fear of being deported. How's that worked out? Asylum seekers, otherwise known as illeeegal immigranttts, are now causing crime all over your city, the schools are bursting at the seams, they get free health care, among other freebies, and schools and homeless vets are displaced to accommodate them. Plus, you're feeding them and putting them up at hotels all over. I have zero sympathy for you. You're the city that gave us Abe Beam, Dave Dinkns, Bill DeBlasio, Eric Adams, AOC, Schumer, Jerry Nadler, Sheldon Silver, Al Sharpton, and Anthony Weiner, just to name a few.

Meanwhile they are becoming richer with inside trading, big pharma money, corruption, lack of standards,  lack of morals, & hyprococy.

Content     : It's hard to have any sympathy for the people of NYC. Republicans haven't controlled the Assembly in 60 years. The most prosperous times in NYC over the same time frame was when Republicans controlled the Governors and Mayor's office. In the 1980s it was Democrat mayor Ed Koch that gave you sanctuary cities. Do you remember why? Elected officials wanted to make sure asylum seekers would not be afraid to report crimes or enroll their kids in public school and get medical care over fear of being deported. 40 years later after virtue signaling, crimes are being committed by these illegals all over the city, schools are bursting at the seams, schools are being closed to accommodate them, homeless vets are being displaced from shelters, Americans and residents have to pay exorbitant health care costs while illegals get free health care, housing and food, and none are deported. On top of that, you've voted for cashless bail, DAs that refuse to prosecute, illegal protests that block traffic and put lives in danger, and other other things that allow the inmates to run the asylum. So don't complain when this is exactly what you've been voting for the past 60 years.

Content     : NY is a smelly, disgusting place with crime running rampant. Thanks to the democrats and Eric Adams. MTA is a joke. Everyday there are at least six subway lines either out of service or seriously delayed. The whole place is run by baboons.

Most are used to warmer weather. They put in a black Mayor to handle it with lack of funds and resources. It is all extreme racism. Trillions sent overseas for wars. Tompkins Square Park was never greatly maintained or landscaped. Now, it is subject to racism and its effects.

You suddenly become ill and need to go to the Emergency Room; however, it is full of these illegal aliens Some are ill because they are not vaccinated against common diseases, and nobody checked that before they crossed the border. Others are malnourished, or suffering from exposure due to the wintry conditions. Some are suffering from their use of drugs. Unfortunately, you voted for politicians who supported  their entry into our sovereign nation. Now, you get to wait your turn while they get treated before you. Understand this one thing; they are there to replace you.

Even if you tax them at over 99% to pay for immigration programs, they still have like a zillion dollars left over for themselves. No reason at all to slow things down this year. They will still vote for the same people who brought them here. Want to know why? Because there is a D next to their name. And because of that D, they are willing to forget all of the pain those politicians brought to their neighborhoods because of they have already been permanently brainwashed into thinking that Republicans are the problem.

There are rest stops, especially one on the California border, that have become outdoor campgrounds for illegal immigrants. And while some are just looking for work, many are looking to perpetrate crimes, taking advantage of free stuff so they can send home whatever they earn off the books. They do not want citizenship, they want benefits.

Content     : Why not worry about how 7 million HOMELESS Americans are suffering?  Over 8000 died last year alone (the government does not keep accurate records so the country does not recognize how large our humanitarian crisis really is!)  The government is openly engaged in democide and social cleansing - killing-off undesirable citizens rather than helping.  Help?  The only help is killing us off.  Then the body brokers and cadaver dealers sell our dead corpses for profit.  One judge claimed "If a corpse is cut into pieces, it can bring in as much as $100,000."  My Ancestors have been in the US since the early 1700's and THIS is what it has become?  Cursed, damned, and doomed.

And are only 3 PortaPottys the equivalent of the facility being refurbished? This is a created problem, either by the city not contracting for enough PortaPottys, or the contractor not providing enough units, and servicing the units frequently enough. Notice I didn't use the word migrant once until now. It's common sense, not rocket science.

Content     : Two congressmen have stated that the Border Patrol said it has had over 10 million encounters with illegal aliens at the border under Biden. NYC has made itself a main sanctuary city destination for economic refugees from all over the world. NYC better raise its tax rates substantially so that it can build 1 million $500 per night hotel rooms for the new unemployed neighbors. And if Biden is reelected, plan on building 2 million more $500 per night hotel rooms. It's also going to get expensive for taxpayers to cover the food, medical, education, and criminal justice costs of all these newcomers, possibly for the rest of their lives. So raise those tax rates RIGHT NOW!

Content     : Biden/Democrats policy at the border: ‚Äúcapture, then release into the U.S. No questions asked, no vaccines or tests for infectious diseases required.‚ÄúU.S. immigration law says capture, detain, grant an asylum hearing, then based on findings of such hearing deport or release. Trump enforced this. When Trump said ‚Äúremain in Mexico,‚Äù the vast majority of these illegals listened.Democratic Mayors‚Äô and DAs‚Äô in Blue cities: policy for black and Hispanic violent criminals is capture and release and then probation (no time).

Content     : I believe this is a calculated set up by the Adams Administration to send a message to other migrants that THEY SHOULD STOP coming to New York. Don't tell me the Parks Department did not know what would happen to the 3 portable toilets in Tompkins Square with the large numbers of migrants lined up at the St Brigids school with the only public toilets , 3 for hundreds of people , in the park. All of this is about using the people freezing in the cold for days as pawns and sending a message to others NOT TO COME to NYC

Then add the cost to yourselves through taxes to maintain the filth. So who are you gonna vote for come November? If it's Biden expect more to come with none being deported. If you vote for Trump this will slow down and hopefully perhaps even end; there's a likelihood many will be deported. It's your choice. Sanctuary for them or sanctuary for yourselves.

Content     : Ridiculous. First of all, IT was arrested, meaning strip search (automatic). Depending on what the arrestee HAS down there, determines gender, short and sweet. No need to ask and feed into this nonsense. If you have female parts, you ARE a female, and vice versa. Doesn‚Äôt matter what you want to be, think you are, or want others to comply with your absurd fantasies.

Clearly, it is not always easy to identify if a person is a male or female. So that being the case, it is appropriate to ask the question: male or female? I was raised to ask a question if I didn't know something. Indeed, most people were likewise raised that was. What is so bad about asking a question (in this case, male or female) if the arresting officer did not know? Maybe going forward the question should be penis or no penis?

In a sane world, Mr. Nonbinary would be charged with felony battery on an officer and felony resisting arrest with force and violence. He would be hauled out to Riker‚Äôs men‚Äôs detention facility, convicted of said felonies and be forced to write the officers apology letters as a condition of probation. But no‚Ä¶. the fetishist is given a forum to lie and whine. And the low IQ, anti -police  citizens review board bends over backwards to find any dishonest reason to malign the cop.

Those who don't want to be judged should stop judging us. The shock value wore out a long time ago. Noone cares. It's facts that boys have a penis and girls a vagina. That's just common sense. Those who wish to live as the opposite sex go for it but show the same respect in return.

A mentally ill cross dressing homosexual at a riot beats on a uniformed officer who cannot discern if his assailant is male or female and asks for clarification during the arrest. 18 months later the cop Is accused of having somehow traumatized the mentally ill cross dressing homosexual by asking for clarification. And this claim is now part of his permanent record.I wonder what the result is of the assault charge against the mentally ill cross dressing homosexual.

If a person identifies as a balloon, and you write the whole article referring to the person as "the balloon", then you are the greater !d10t...unless you're joking, then you're hilarious.  Adopting their distorted language re-enforces mass delusion.  Also stop using the word "trans".  There is no such a thing.  Transitioning from one sex to another is a scientific impossibility.

Content     : Well I see another writer at this rapidly degrading so called newspaper is woke! Using the term "them" in this story is a joke. There are only two genders period which are referred to as boy, girl, man, women, female, male, she, he, him or her! It would be better to discribe this "whatever" as I an it but that would be an insult too. It is so sad that we are nowiving in a world of make beleive and the fake news personnel are all in on it! Disgusting.

Content     : Hospitals are forced to accept Medicare which doesn't pay enough to cover operational costs, this is the reason for all the recent hospital closures.  Wait until everyone is forced into medicare advantage plans at work. Then see how many hospital go chapter 11 or close completely.  Right now those who have private insurances and coupled with those insured through regular traditional medicare's supplemental insurances are keeping what is left of the hospital systems afloat.

Content     : SUNY Downstate also has multiple residency programs. The residents would have  be ‚Äúorphaned‚Äù to places with enough infrastructure and encounters to complete their training. An educated guess? Many of them would end up at Brookdale due to its size and many programs. That being said, many of them could end up leaving the state or in smaller programs.  Sending residents to SUNY Upstate would be a way to retain what SNY receives (for training residents), plus Syracuse has a lower cost of living and higher quality of life*.This article ignores the fact that Kingsbrook basically became a feeder ER after being rolled into One Brookdale Health (OBH).Despite SUNY Downstate‚Äôs proximity to Kings County, there will be less healthcare in Brooklyn. One does have to admire how politicians and their media supporters are so skilled at messaging. People wouldn‚Äôt believe fewer hospitals could supply the same amount of care without great marketing. üòÇ  * Ignoring ethnic food and some cultural needs.

Content     : Initially, the Rooney Rule was put in place primarily as window dressing for the NFL. They knew they had a problem because many owners never looked at "the content of their character" with non-white coaches. They never gave them a chance to compete for the jobs. The kept recycling the same coaches, many of whom had losing records with multiple teams. For years, interviews with non-white coaches were all show, with owners never giving those candidates real consideration. The success of Mike Tomlin and, more recently, Todd Bowles, suggests that giving black coaches a chance to interview for a job can work well for a team, and in the NFL, everyone tries to copy success. Remember. the Rooney Rule does not require hiring someone, merely that you interview minority coaches. If they earn the job with the interview- Great. If they do not - so be it. Why whine about giving people a chance? Isn't it the American Dream to have a chance to succeed?

Content     : "...released 38 cop killers since 2017." This is outrageous and it will continue as an insult to all law enforcement, their families and law-abiding citizens. NYS is unlivable and the police are continuously derogated by politicians and citizens alike. On the day of the parole hearing, for their sake and that of all future officers, EVERY officer in the state should walk off the job until the day the governor, mayor, and/or legislators pass an immediate law calling for life imprisonment with NO PAROLE. Of course there will be chaos - let the pols call in the National Guard to restore some order. Doing so will result in the end of many of their political careers. They will have to make the decision - a law or their career. Young officer Byrne's death can ultimately be a catalyst for some real change.

Content     : The facts of this unfortunate case are simple. Whether this creep remains in prison or not, there is no way that Officer Byrne or his family can be made whole. That time passed with his murder. So what do we have left to consider? Simply, does society benefit or lose from releasing this murderer? At first glance some might make the case that the taxpayers are saving the cost of his incarceration. But given New York‚Äôs incessant need to abet criminals, this guy will probably be automatically enrolled in a variety of programs which will be as, if not more expensive as his prison tab. And what about society at large? Well with the influx of identified terrorists who have gleefully been admitted from abroad, I suppose one or two more is not going to move the needle in our crime-o-meter much further in the red zone. But I think most rational people would prefer not testing that theory. The only reason the parole board is so laissez-faire about these releases is they believe none of these parolees or any other criminals will ever threaten them or darken their door. They might be correct. But hope springs eternal.

Content     : Thank you to all NYC Police Officers for doing what you do. Yes you have a job to do but be smart. When you go to work remember articles like this. Most important thing is your family. If the city cared for you they wouldn‚Äôt have let out 37 cop killers since 2017. Do what you have to do but remember you work for a liberal city and they only care when they need you

The report said his job was to distract not murder! He has served over 30 years, which is more of the life of the cop that was murdered. By the family having a remberence every year only prolongs the grieving process. He has done his time and has to live with what he has done for his remaining life time constantly looking over his shoulder. Plus he will be used to routine from prison life and may not cope outside of prison, with no job, no home and no living family, he will be alone. He will suffer more outside in cilivan life than prison life.Something g for the family to take comfort in.

Content     : The Seths are obviously looking for their payday and making lawyer-coached comments and turned to media to gain outrage and support from viewers to paint this Pediatrician as some kinda monster.   According to what I've read in the article, it seems that No. 1, there is enough evidence to prove that the Pediatrician stopped, gave statements, and then left.  Number 2, there is no law, even if you are a MD, that precludes this Pediatrician to give aid to a victim of an accident, the MD is protected.  No. 3, it's quite possible that the Pediatrician does not have the skills/training or practice for life-saving emergencies or is not comfortable doing so for many reasons, seems like it would be a bad judgement that he left the scene, but not criminal.  I have no worries that the Seths will get paid handsomely by the insurance company.

I wrote a comment saying that people of a certain background (that came from a European country shaped like a boot) are known for running down pedestrians with their vehicles. My comment was allowed to post with no problem. Then I changed the nationality to reflect some people that have ancestry from the African continent. I said that these people are known for doing this type of thing. My comment was immediately rejected. I apologize for politicizing this horrible incident and hope that father and daughter have a speedy and full recovery.

I see in this case and some others, not all. why is there a go fund me for medical bills? he works for the city, has the best insurance available. yes, there is rehab, etc. all covered. maybe some inpatient co-pays, meds rehab office visits. most all policies max at 1 mil. could she benefit for some dollies, video games? of course. also, their medical expenses will be paid 100% by drivers/driver. third party liability makes driver pay 1st. if there is any problem Dads insurance pays. every time I see injury stories, too much go fund me. he will get a large end payout on top. sounds like rehab is key,  if there is more problems, still getting paid. my what the article says,, she/ dad are very lucky. great!!!!!

Content     : I don't know if this man did it or not, but the cops laser-focused on him from day one.In those days, it was in vogue to blame husbands or domestic partners every time, which made the cops job that much easier; however, many, many people were exonerated because of faulty police work.10 years prior, it was in vogue to go after adults for pedophelia based on the testimony of kids coached by mandated reporters such as McMartin preschool fiasco.

And why did Scott hide from cops, withdraw cash, bleach his hair blonde and was on his way to the Mexican border to flee the US when caught, if he was an innocent widower? Spending more money on this psychopath who murdered his wife and baby instead of devoting resources to victim survivors is a travesty. I hope they are not tax funded.

All the circumstantial evidences does point to him being guilty but I do have one issue that bothers me‚Ä¶the boat. Why didn‚Äôt the prosecution try the reenactment of what the defense did? Wouldn‚Äôt you want the jury to see that it was possible to dump 150+lb dead weight over the side of the boat which is essentially just a row boat with an outboard motor? I‚Äôve been  on a boat like that and just getting trying to get in or standing up in it will seriously start rocking the boat side to side. It will be interesting to follow this case going forward for sure.

Remember Amber Frey, the woman he told he lost his wife, and pursued romantically. He couldn't have acted with more consciousness of guilt, in every thing he did. His little boy Conor, whom he slaughtered like a hog inside his mother's belly, getting ready to be born. He would have been in college, maybe a golfer, like Scott. He would have been a gorgeous young man. He would have been getting ready to now start his adult life. No, Scott forfeited all the rest of his life, for such cold-blooded heartless murder. Connor was born in the death of his mom, whose body released him, and he floating up,  miraculously landing on the shore, fully and perfectly whole a baby, who looked viable, four months later, on Easter Friday, and then the torso of Laci washed up. If that wasn't God, and a MIRACLE,  I don't know what people would be thinking happened. Of course he murdered his wife and baby on Christmas Eve, making plans to start a new life with Amber. GUILTY AS SIN, FOREVER.

Strawberry used to hit rockets with a swing that looked so effortless , it was amazing ! Its a shame that they both went to drugs but so many other players did the same thing in that era. I think they would both be Hall of Famers if they had stayed away from that . Gooden doesn't look good , he looks much older than he is .

Content     : Straw is so right about so much. There was pure joy when Doc was pitching. That ascent in 85 was magical. When Doc was scheduled to pitch, it felt more like a celebration. Just watching him warm up with that classic windup... the sheer beauty. When the ball came off Strawberry's bat with that lovely swing and headed out, it was pure exhilaration. It's great to hear they are both here with us and on a better path. Had the good fortune to see them many times. Was there in Game 5 of the 86 NLCS: Nolan Ryan vs. Doc Gooden. Bought the tickets off a cab driver on the way home. Also, Game 2 and Game 7 of the World Series. After Game 6 when they came back, I went outside for a walk so happy. My brother was walking home saw me and said later I had the oddest smile as we crossed silently by.

Now they are an adversay of Christianity, especially the Catholic faith.    Because science tried desperately to discredit the miracole of the wounds of Christ the bled every day on Padre Pio's hands and feet and continuously gave off the fragrance of roses.   ----  Why do people want to know nothing about God when they will surely meet Him the day they die?

Content     : Shia, if you're reading this, don't feel bad about your sexual movie past (God understands that nothing can be erased in this digital era). There's a Catholic saint who used to worship Satan before he converted (Blessed Bartolo Longo). And those who murdered people before they converted to Catholicism (St. Moses The Ethiopian and St. Olga, for example). And a woman who used to have sex with a lot of young men before she converted (St. Mary of Egypt). So, Mr. LaBeouf, you don't have to worry about your movie past, if you are.I'm an Asian man (a cradle Catholic) in my mid-40s who used to look at adult material, but now had stopped. And now I'm stronger in my faith and I've learned to fear thy Lord. It's important to fear thy Lord, according to St. Paul...I don't want God to hate me because I don't want to go to Hell, that's what I always say in my prayers. I believe fearing thy Lord really helps people to stop sinning gravely. I hope you and everyone here in the comments section to take care.Love in Christ, Kenny

He claimed to have stigmata in his hands, supposedly the same wounds Jesus would have had as crucified.But as all experts in anatomy have stated, it's impossible to crucify someone by nailing through the hands, the nails must go through the wrists, as the hands can't support the weight of the body.

Content     : I left a comment yesterday and I didn't even read the article, but looking through the article I understand that there are a two ex-girlfriends that say that he was abusive and one of them (FKA twigs) even said that she ended up with an STD from him.And I even found out on the Internet that FKA twigs, when she was a kid, won a scholarship to a Roman Catholic school. Karolyn Pho is Vietnamese, so I'm thinkin' she's very likely Catholic or Buddhist. I don't know any of the three. And I don't even know if the women are telling the truth. But if they are telling the truth, I can understand the pain they must've gone through. And if FKA twigs is having a hard time dealing with the STD, I feel for her. But at the same time, here's my belief: If you want God to forgive you for your sins, then the right thing to do is to forgive other people who have sinned against you.  I don't hate anyone. I believe in miracles. I hope all three of them can heal.Love in Christ,Kenny

Now they are an adversay of Christianity, especially the Catholic faith.    Because science tried desperately to discredit the miracole of the wounds of Christ the bled every day on Padre Pio's hands and feet and continuously gave off the fragrance of roses.   ----  Why do people want to know nothing about God when they will surely meet Him the day they die?

Content     : Shia, if you're reading this, don't feel bad about your sexual movie past (God understands that nothing can be erased in this digital era). There's a Catholic saint who used to worship Satan before he converted (Blessed Bartolo Longo). And those who murdered people before they converted to Catholicism (St. Moses The Ethiopian and St. Olga, for example). And a woman who used to have sex with a lot of young men before she converted (St. Mary of Egypt). So, Mr. LaBeouf, you don't have to worry about your movie past, if you are.I'm an Asian man (a cradle Catholic) in my mid-40s who used to look at adult material, but now had stopped. And now I'm stronger in my faith and I've learned to fear thy Lord. It's important to fear thy Lord, according to St. Paul...I don't want God to hate me because I don't want to go to Hell, that's what I always say in my prayers. I believe fearing thy Lord really helps people to stop sinning gravely. I hope you and everyone here in the comments section to take care.Love in Christ, Kenny

It doesn't matter who takes the helm accusations of anti-semitism are subjective and can be lobbed at anyone. Unless we come up with a standard definition or clear guides of what defines anti-semitism - right now the definition in mainstream biased media is whatever angers the jews, but it shouldn't be that. That's very wrong! In fact, currently the most anti-semitic country is Israel. It has killed 24,000 semites. That's hypocrisy. If you go around calling everyone anti-semitic, and then turn around and kill 24,000 people (Palestinians - civilians, Hamas - terrorists, and Israelis -soldiers and hostages) ALL SEMITES to push your political agenda then you Israel and the IDF are the biggest anti-semites.

Jews are the biggest proponents of globalist ideologies like DEI and using it as a KPI for corporation‚Äôs ESG scores.So Jewish people first teach DEI and Marxism, then enforce globalism in the corporate boardrooms with ESG. Now they claim to be victims of it. How full circle of them! This is just more, made-up victimhood from the inventors of victim ideology.

Content     : Let me get this straight. Criticism of anything Jewish is antisemitism? How does anything grow or thrive in a vacuum? Criticism is not always meant to be negative. In fact, it can be an incredibly valuable tool for growth and improvement. Being critical is making note of merits and flaws in a given topic. Perhaps one should consider how criticism in itself is fraught with fallacies - eg., petito principii or " begging the question"   or  the False dilemma fallacy.Being critical isn‚Äôt being hateful by definition. Saying what is true and what isn‚Äôt true is not an act of hate. Done graciously it‚Äôs an act of love, of charity, of kindness. It is done out of regard for one‚Äôs fellow-man, out of concern for their well-being and that care must extend to the manner in which questions are investigated and truth is announced. There is truth. We should seek it and we should reject the lazy identification of the search for truth with hate.Critical - adjective. 1. Containing or making severe or negatve judgements.2. Containing careful or analytical evaluations.

The signature picture of Jerusalem- the Jewish holy city,which Jews re-captured in another war imposed upon them -- is the golden dome of Islam.  The old city has only ONE quarter for Jews: two of Christans  and one of Muslims.  If you don't call that open and respectful of others, then you are the problem.   Neither Christans or Muslims have been so kind to Jewish populations when THEY conquered the land.

From my studies in History I know the opposite was true. Example‚ÄîSpanish Inquisition when all Jews were forced to convert, if they didn‚Äôt they were forced to leave the country and if they did convert and secretly practiced Judaism they were killed.  The Crusades when the Crusaders slaughtered Jews on their way to Jerusalem .  The Pogroms in Russia when the Jews were forced to live in the Pale and it was open game for the Cossacks to go village by village and slaughter Jews in the name of the Church. Just a few example to refute this anti semitic professor  I want this professor to provide factual examples of his statements.  Proof, Proof not just hate of the Jewish people   What a shame that Harvard is continuing to show Jewish Zhstered

At least you can defend yourself against a claim of sexual assault in court, but anti-semitism? That's the worst accusation of all. There is no defense, you can end up being ruined for the rest of your life, and lose your livelihood, your competence is questioned, you are publicly ridiculed. It is the modern day "Scarlet Letter". But ask yourselves, for what? What is the purpose of ruining lives over unfounded, unproven claims???

Sat by as 450,000  Yemanites died by an Iran  backed civil war, 90,000 of which were children . So  many more hundreds of thousands killed in the middle east  without a single march in protest . Darfur 200,000 killed by Sudans gov. 1000 on Oct 2023 ,Lebanon ,Iraq  etc.  In the 75 year Israeli  Arab  conflict about 100,000 Arabs have died .  Including the soldiers in all the wars . You would think it was millions ! But you know all about those 100,000.  Because Jew haters make sure to claim everyone of those deaths was unjust. You see , Jews are not supposed to defend themselves and fight back. Jews are supposed to die when attacked! When 6,000,000 jews died the New York Times ignored it as did the world . Well NEVER AGAIN !Hypocrites, with their unjust selective outrage are just antisemetic haters . If  the shoe fits wear it .

He has taken loans from Russians, had a Trump Tower plan in Moscow and reversed Ambassador Nikki Haley's threatened Russia sanctions on their WMD companies. He also took trademarks awarded by China. He then reversed the US ban on ZTE spy phones despite other countries still having one and Biden reinstating ours. Trump pulls rickshaw for Xi, Putin and Kim.

Content     : The bad part about this is that Republicans are going down the same path which led to losses in the past two election terms. It is clear on a general election level that Trump and extreme MAGA candidates cannot win in a general election. (See the 2022 midterms) In Nikki Haley, they actually have a leader with lots of foreign policy experience and one who truly believes in the rule of law for ALL. No exceptions based upon party, status, gender, fame, any of it. With Haley, it is very clear to all of our allies that we support them and clear to our enemies that we will be rock solid in our commitment to democracy and freedom worldwide. Zelenskyy earlier this week summed it up when he said "I am concerned about Trump potentially returning to the White House because I don't think he understands the situation fully and when he makes statements saying he could end the war in 24 hours, it clearly shows."

Stefanik is nothing more than an embarrassment a shameful stupid selfish woman that does not care about the Nation.  We need people in office that love the Country and the people of the Country and what is good for the Nation and the standing of the Nation in the eyes of the wold -- that is neither Trump nor is it Stefanie -- both need to be out of government -- they both need to go quietly.  But they have no dignity no self respect nd they have proven they do not have love of Country and those that gave their lives for the Nation -- love your country -- it is the only country you have --

Content     : To have genuine representative democracy, there first needs to be a truly democratic electoral system for the citizenry. The electoral system is a large part of the illusion masquerading as real democracy. And, of course, many voters get to wait in long, bad-weather lineups to participate.While the First Past The Post ballot [FPTP] may qualify, though barely at that, as democratic within the democracy spectrum, it is the proportionally representative system thus governance that's truly representative, regardless of political ideology.FPTP does seem to serve corporate lobbyists well, however. I believe it is why such powerful interests generally resist attempts at changing from FPTP to proportional representation electoral systems of governance, the latter which dilutes corporate influence. Low-representation FPTP-elected governments, in which a relatively small portion of the country's populace is actually electorally represented, are likely the easiest for lobbyists to manipulate or ‚Äòbuy‚Äô.It can and often enough does enable the biggest of businesses to get unaccountably even bigger, defying the very spirit of government rules established to ensure healthy competition by limiting mass consolidation.

He then reversed the US ban on ZTE spy phones despite other countries still having one and Biden reinstating ours. Trump pulls rickshaw for Xi, Putin and Kim.

Or well for example one guy outside was called a junkie or homeless guy and well wasn't. He was actually unique with two college degrees and immune to coke heroin meth and crack so he can't do any of it. And was outside for buddhistic ideals

Content     : it's called public service for a reason. the theory that the public sector has to pay as much as the private sector to retain staff misses the whole point about why people work in government. it is not about the money.that is the theory anyway -- but of course over time the public sector is 100% corrupt 100% of the time. i think it began in the 60s when the public sector started unionizing -- which is nonsense.the trade-off for not being paid as much as (in theory) the private sector -- i doubt new law grads make $215k at "firms" -- is job security. that and the warm glow of knowing you are helping your community. in this case the lady can't be fired -- since she's in the public sector -- and yet she gets private sector pay -- and since she can't be fired she just gets paid to stay home. which is nonsense -- but it follows the logic the government has invented for itself.

Content     : I cannot believe that she is still on the payroll and received a bonus despite her absence.  By doing this, the District Attorney has insulted the hardworking attorneys and civilian staff, and has lost all credibility as a district attorney.  People must start to wonder how he can possibly justify paying a hefty salary to an absentee employee.   There are people who have legitimate concerns or health concerns which may warrant remote work which cannot work remotely but the D.A. is continuing to pay her a hefty salary and bonus for staying home.  This is an outrage and should be enough for us to elect someone new.

The end goal is their own self-advancement, the transfer of achievements from those who have earned them to those who have not, using a fraudulent moral argument as the justification.
