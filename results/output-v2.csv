85,2,291,"Jordan and the Impeachment inquiry committees have a better response to Garland. At this moment Hunter Biden is in the White House. Since the House now has passed authorization of the impeachment Inquiry investigation, issue new subpoenas for Hunter Biden and his bank records and any other documents that they want in Hunter Biden or Joe Biden’s possession. Present those subpoenas publicly first to Hunter Biden, demanding that Biden present Hunter, who’s in the White House, to publicly accept Congress’ subpoena, requiring that Hunter appear before Congress. Give copies to the White House’s Counsel’s office publicly demanding, that President of the United States Joesph R. Biden, enforce United States law and publicly require that his son obey the House subpoena. Failure to comply with that legal request by the House Impeachment Inquiry Committees would result in the passage of House voting Hunter Biden with contempt of Congress and Joe Biden with the impeachable offense of obstruction of Congress and failure to protect the Constitution of the United States. That would either force Hunter to plead the 5th, and in Hunter’s and Biden’s case drink a 5th, or testify in deposition in front of the legal staffs of the impeachment Inquiry Committees.

1934,1,321,"(POST 1/5)Too many red flags in this story. From all accounts I've read here's what I've found. the first documented report of illness was Nov. 30th when the boy (who had some unspecified mental difficulties) was sent home sick after vomiting in school. The mother has claimed that he had typical cold symptoms, but vomiting is not a typical symptom of a cold. Sometime between the 30th and the morning they passed away, the girl had been reported acting ""irrationally"" at school to include biting and spitting. These are not cold or typical ear infection symptoms. The idea that this is reported gives credit to the idea that this is not typical behavior for her. Any change in a persons behavior or mental status is cause for a medical evaluation and my be a sign of an underlying condition rapidly worsening. Flu symptoms can normally last up to a week; this had been going on for over 2 weeks by the time the kids died. The father (only in the home on weekends) also stated that the kids needed to go to the emergency room; but for whatever reason, they weren't taken. Most repultible and detailed articles state that the mother says she found the kids ""Violently Ill/Vomiting"" at roughly 3am. She then gave them typlenol, and took a shower. (Assuming if the vomiting was that violent, she may have come into contact with it; needed a shower).

2013,2,227,Let's cut to the obvious.The establishment has decided to ditch Biden ( hence the negative articles popping up everywhere) and slot in some other controllable candidate  like Gavin Newsom or Kamala. That's  on the Dems side. On the GOP side the establishment wants warmonger Nikki Haley. In that scenario the establishment can't  lose because both parties are the same. Neither of these candidates will fight for the middle class. They will only protect their billionaire donors.

Then the precincts shutdown down and Republicans were asked to leave. This only happened in Democratic precincts in swing states.  The precincts reopened at 3am and Biden was in the lead.

Yeah, 3 deflected goals - but 'shoot the puck Barry', then stuff can happen; can't win if ya don't shoot. Nice production from Schneids, Gus, Vesey, yes, even Wheeler - and Igor; can't expect to stop a couple of killer Mathews shots. Cuylle solid too. They seem to be a team that can't consistently manifest the intensity to always play to win - but can turn it on when they really need to, when they have something to prove, often vs the best teams in the NHL - just as us fans get that little tiny bit of doubt creeping in.

The Focus & priority will be to improve the offensive line, from a talent and intelligence standpoint. The draft is one area, but free agency will be vital as every other team in the NFL will be looking to fortify their offensive line as well.

Don’t fall into the Media dumb game like one week Wilson is the best thing next week jets needs to cut him. Stop being Monday morning QB. Hit with the facts. Jets had a good team coming into this year where Donald Duck ( Hackett could of been OC) because it’s Rodgers offense. We just saw what happens when Hackett has to coach he can’t so he should be fired hands down. Fat boy JD who has no pulse to begin with didn’t even give Rodgers a shot with that OL so even if our 40yr old QB played he would be on the side lines crying and ripping the OL. As far as Saleh he can only play with what these idiots give him. Yes the penalties/ discipline we can knock him for but he had no OL  and no QB worth a crumb to play with. He’s a defensive coach so let’s look at that and it speaks for it self the last two years. Woody Johnson is the problem here. He can’t see he needs to bring in an offensive coach to run the offense.

Hollywood fears them, politicians fear them, and us regular people are enslaved by supporting them. They also used TikTok to manipulate people into thinking the US released the Covid weapon from a US lab.If we were a true leader of justice, we would invade China, take everything over, put all leadership on trial and extract every last dollar to start repaying the victims of covid.

This above is gaslighting! That comment has nothing to do with point customers are being cheated with higher prices plus employes casual under giving you protein. The spoon scoop is absurd and the mgmt keeps the spoon only to give customers less!! Do you scoop stuff at home when making our your own food. Ofc not, you measure everything out. They are scum for doing this.I have to keep remembering not to use the chipotle app to order as I I don't open it till I get home and its too late and of course they hide the meet under all the rice and sour cream.

4831,1,305,I went to chipotle a few weeks ago and the person building my food had an attitude with me. I watched her skimp my portions clear to the end and she rolled the burrito up to be the size of a tennis ball. so I called her out on it pointing out that it was a 12 dollar burrito (Arizona) and the size was pathetic. she copped a bigger attitude and the cashier that joined in was trying to defend the tiny burrito. I pointed to the next burrito coming down the line that was HUGE and asked > why mine didn't look like that? at that point I had both girls getting loud at me at the same time. the one offered to add more or remake it.  I just had her add more.  I went back last night and the guy gave me real portions. no attitude. no expectation that I beg for more. he just made it correctly.   its not a great business model to have non standardized portions.,N/A,,
