You buy seats according to their terms and their sizes. They make a profit. And they deserve to. That's life.  If you don't fit in a standard seat, either buy two or fly business or first class.

Content     : Does she then also get the food meant for the extra seats? She most likely does, because with her estimated 350 pounds she needs at least 500 daily calories more compared to a 140 pound woman, just in order to maintain her weight.Did you know, that since people on average have gained 8% during the last 30 years, a normal plane now weighs ONE tonne more. This has caused many operational headaches for airlines, which will become worse, as people are continuing to gain weight. Than you, Leanne.

Content     : This idea that just because you're too fat to fit in a seat on an airline that you should get a "FREE" seat or two-Southwest, really angers me.  After I beat cancer, I gain A LOT of weight to the point I was obese.  My oncologist told me that I needed to lose weight to prevent other cancers from possible occurring.  So I had the gastric sleeve surgery-which is covered by most if not all insurance if deemed medically necessary.  HOWEVER, I had to make changes in what I ate and drank, worked with a nutritionist BEFORE I could get the green light for the surgery.  So it is not fair that people who make poor nutritional decisions should get a FREE seat.  I put in the time, effort and made changes to lose the weight.  Why should someone who does not be rewarded?  I realize that not everyone who is obese is large because of what they eat, but there are people who may have medical conditions and maybe they could be an accommodation for them.  If your too fat for an economy seat, then buy a first class ticket.  Who do you think is going to pay for these free "PERSON OF SIZE" seats?

At least they didn't say that. So WHY did they stop sending them?Two years in (2022) everyone (who survived) was back to business as usual, so what happened here?

Content     : This is a step in the correct direction. However, as a tax preparer, I assure you that almost everything filed on paper forms during the shutdown has been mishandled. Massive penalties and interest have been accrued on pass-through entities for ‚Äòfailing to file an extension‚Äô.The IRS has charged folks for failure to file after cashing the checks that were in the envelope with the tax returns. They have either thrown away returns as they did in the late 1980‚Äôs or they've lost the return in their ‚Äòsystem‚Äô.Regardless the IRS today does not have the half the talent they had when I was practicing as a CPA.The decline of the federal government‚Äôs purpose of serving us morphing into a heavy-handed feared force has been disenheartening to witness.This politicized heavy handedness is especially distressing having witnessed the unnecessary raids of homes of people who would have voluntarily picked up a warrant.The federal government and its favoritism of all leftists is psycho - and a major problem the government must be forced back to being fair - if it takes defunding and some mayhem - so be it.

I thought they were going to catch more people who cheat on their taxes, instead of finding ways to let them get out of paying what they owe. So we pay almost a billion dollars for new IRS agents and we end up rewarding those who don't pay....democratic party votes, bought and paid for on the backs of hard working people who do pay their taxes. These antics belong right up there with paying off student loans, hoping to be rewarded at the election polls. Biden's vote buying schemes continue.

Content     : After reading the article, it looks like only the late payment fees are being forgiven.The taxpayer is still responsible for their tax liability.Since the government usually charges higher fees than your average mobster, I don‚Äôt necessarily disagree with forgiving the outrageous fees that the IRS charge.As a father who recently put two daughters through NYU, I know the costs associated. I did not take government student loans because their interest rates were so high that I could get much lower rates on the street.While I oppose the blanket forgiveness of student loans, I do think that something needs to be done about the high compounding interest they carry. That is what people need help with.

At least they didn't say that. So WHY did they stop sending them?Two years in (2022) everyone (who survived) was back to business as usual, so what happened here?

Content     : Do YOU want some questionable homemade baked good or a handknit scarf? Multiply that by 20+ students, at least in elementary school, that‚Äôs a lot of baked goods that will get dumped in the teachers lounge. Also, chances are you are neither an amazing baker or knitter, despite what you think. And for all the quibbles over the amount, multiple teachers, etc. Do you get a bonus, do you quibble over tipping your postal person, hair stylist, garbage man/woman, doorman, people that are not helping raise your children? Lots of plumbers/electricians/service people get extra cash and gift cards this time of year from their regulars.The only one I understand her list is the Starbucks card, because every teacher I know likes and uses them because the coffee in the teachers lounge is awful and you can get some ok food options. Heck, one teacher I know appreciates them because she in turn can regift or use to buy gifts.And no, I‚Äôm not nor ever have been a teacher. I‚Äôd just rather give them something they want and can use vs something I think they should want or worse, that they should be simply grateful to receive.
