Since the House now has passed authorization of the impeachment Inquiry investigation, issue new subpoenas for Hunter Biden and his bank records and any other documents that they want in Hunter Biden or Joe Biden\u2019s possession.

Biden, enforce United States law and publicly require that his son obey the House subpoena. Failure to comply with that legal request by the House Impeachment Inquiry Committees would result in the passage of House voting Hunter Biden with contempt of Congress and Joe Biden with the impeachable offense of obstruction of Congress and failure to protect the Constitution of the United States. That would either force Hunter to plead the 5th, and in Hunter\u2019s and Biden\u2019s case drink a 5th, or testify in deposition in front of the legal staffs of the impeachment Inquiry Committees.

Its why they protect corrupt Biden and crucify Trump. They give them healthcare, legal aid, food, shelter, even created sanctuary cities to protect them from prosecution. In June 2023, Los Angeles became a sanctuary city by the Democratic run City Council. If re-elected, Trump stops them by continuing the wall Biden stopped. That is why they persecute him. That's why they protect Biden at all cost. They know they can beat the other candidates. Trump is the problem. If a Democrat wins the Presidency, the Democrat Party importation of voters continues. 15 million becomes 30 million. The Democrats will flip every battleground state to them. The Republicans will not be able to elect a President or a Senator. It will be almost impossible to elect a Congressman or Congresswoman. Its all about the border. The Republicans and Trump should tell America EVERYDAY why the Democrats are persecuting him and protecting Biden - it's all about the border and the Democrat Party's plan to take over America - and become our DICTATORS. Its the biggest story in America since the Civil War."}

Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Nicholas Mayorkas is obliterating our border.\"Then advance the premise that whereas the US Constitution; Article 2; Section 1; Clause 5, provides \"No Person except a natural born Citizen, or a Citizen of the United States, at the time of the Adoption of this Constitution, shall be eligible to the Office of President; neither shall any Person be eligible to that Office who shall not have attained to the Age of thirty five Years, and been fourteen Years a Resident within the United States,\" so should be the requirement to serve as a Cabinet Secretary.As it stands, it is only required that there be a presidential nomination then a Senate confirmation to be appointed.  This could be changed by legislative action without need for a redundant Constitutional Amendment.Mayorkas is operating as if he's a Castro Cuban operative with a hidden agenda to destroy the USA from within.Last similar episode was Clinton's appointment of Secretary of State Madeleine Korbe Albright who was born in Czechoslovakia.  She certainly advanced Europe's interests at US taxpayers' expense, not the least of which was US direct military involvement in Bosnia-Kosovo war.Because Cabinet positions are effectively compartments of the President's Article II authority, to serve in those positions should have the same requirements to serve as president."}

The Mets as currently constructed are a 68-70 win team, given teams always lose 5 wins or more from their worst 20 players. They won't contend short of a record $370m payroll plus $100m in taxes, which isn't happening, and since the problems of 2024 will persist into 2025 (no current Mets minor leaguer will have reached MLB during the 2024 season and established himself as a regular to be inked into the 2025 roster) the Mets won't be contending in 2025, either. That established, why would you spend huge money on two pitchers only to waste their best two seasons on 2024 and 2025? Their average seasons from Hader and Snell would add 5 wins in 2024, making the Mets a 73-75 win team.Heyman is being dishonest with us because his job is to try to keep fans interested in a hopelessly mismanaged Mets team until it becomes relevant in 2026---at the earliest.

Men have often killed to protect what they believe are their exclusive reproductive rights in a woman (or to prevent a woman's escape from their possession of those rights).  Killing the kids, especially the one only six weeks old, makes me think he thought she was stepping out on him, and that at least that baby wasn't his.I'm not justifying it by explaining it. Just saying that it's not all that surprising, especially if he thinks any of those kids aren't really his.  Biology trumps the penal code, not often so expressly like this, but in a myriad of ways that we highly refined hairless apes try to ignore as irrelevant vestiges of our past beastliness.  Thing is, we're still beasts.If he knew the kids were his, he would have been more likely to kill just the wife.  And maybe the mother-in-law.  I mean, why not kill the mother-in-law if you're gonna do some killing?  Doesn't everyone with a mother-in-law sometimes wish them dead?If our justice/vengeance system better reflected our beastly impulses as it once did, this guy, along with at least four or five more of his family, should be killed in retribution.  But in the old system, if she was stepping out on him, he could have killed her and her lover with impunity, perhaps even the kids if they weren't his."}

{"uid": 1703028690169859, "text": "(POST 1/5)Too many red flags in this story. From all accounts I've read here's what I've found. the first documented report of illness was Nov. 30th when the boy (who had some unspecified mental difficulties) was sent home sick after vomiting in school. The mother has claimed that he had typical cold symptoms, but vomiting is not a typical symptom of a cold. Sometime between the 30th and the morning they passed away, the girl had been reported acting \"irrationally\" at school to include biting and spitting. These are not cold or typical ear infection symptoms. The idea that this is reported gives credit to the idea that this is not typical behavior for her. Any change in a persons behavior or mental status is cause for a medical evaluation and my be a sign of an underlying condition rapidly worsening. Flu symptoms can normally last up to a week; this had been going on for over 2 weeks by the time the kids died. The father (only in the home on weekends) also stated that the kids needed to go to the emergency room; but for whatever reason, they weren't taken. Most repultible and detailed articles state that the mother says she found the kids \"Violently Ill/Vomiting\" at roughly 3am. She then gave them typlenol, and took a shower. (Assuming if the vomiting was that violent, she may have come into contact with it; needed a shower). According to those same articles, she then saw the children in \"Medical distress and foaming from the mouth and nose\"."}

If he is back in form and Quick continues to maintain his, then opponents are going to get very few easy nights while playing the RangersIt's hard to find fault in a 5-2 road win versus a good team. Overall Blake Wheeler had a very good game but on Toronto's second goal he let Matthews skate behind him right down the slot. He's not going to miss from there. He had his back turned while covering no one out in front.Same with The Maple leafs first goal.

The Focus & priority will be to improve the offensive line, from a talent and intelligence standpoint. The draft is one area, but free agency will be vital as every other team in the NFL will be looking to fortify their offensive line as well.  Having said that their failure to learn from last year's mistakes are inexcusable and if they get off to a slow start in 2024 the coach & GM won't deserve the right to finish the season.

Jets had a good team coming into this year where Donald Duck ( Hackett could of been OC) because it\u2019s Rodgers offense. We just saw what happens when Hackett has to coach he can\u2019t so he should be fired hands down. Fat boy JD who has no pulse to begin with didn\u2019t even give Rodgers a shot with that OL so even if our 40yr old QB played he would be on the side lines crying and ripping the OL. As far as Saleh he can only play with what these idiots give him. Yes the penalties/ discipline we can knock him for but he had no OL  and no QB worth a crumb to play with. He\u2019s a defensive coach so let\u2019s look at that and it speaks for it self the last two years. Woody Johnson is the problem here.

One thing for certain -- superior Harvard-types don't like to be embarrassed. They're above all that. Enough is enough.In addition, Gay has already purportedly cost the school $1 billion in donations. That number will certainly rise. Some early applicants for the fall 2024 school year who have already been ACCEPTED to Harvard are now having second thoughts. They don't want the notoriety. And there is the mealy-mouthed \"context\" answer Gay gave to Congress a couple of weeks ago, when she and two other university presidents, one of whom resigned, testified. Likely outcome to all this? Harvard will announce Gay is resigning to \"spend more time with her family.\""}

O liners Budde, Jim Tyrer, Mo Moorman, Dave Hill were all 6'5 or taller.  most oliners/dliners those days, again most, were 6'1 to 6'3...these guys towered on the field.  Impressive in person, I am sure NY Jets fans my age can recall these Chiefs. "}

Our population actually increased by 48,000 inhabitants known as migrants. No matter what you refer to them as, migrants or asylum seekers, they are actually illegal immigrants!! The other states that experienced a population increase, are the states where actual citizens of New York fled to. It stands to reason because how can you expect citizens who actually pay taxes, provide their own housing and worked to achieve the American Dream, put up with having their essential services reduced by 5% for now, put up with this nonsense. They never imagined that they would achieve all of the above only to have their hard work result in feeding, housing, clothing and providing essential services for illegal immigrants. For anyone who states that these citizens have an obligation to do so is ludicrous. All of these other states are absolutely thrilled in having these hard working New Yorkers become part of their communities."}

In 1923 U.S. population was 112 million. Today 339 million or triple what it was.For argument's sake lets say it triples again by 2123. Out of control immigration will guarantee that. Double would be 678 million. Do you really believe that wind/solar power will provide all our energy needs for double, let alone triple the current population? I think not.A long time ago in my 7th grade science class, the teacher filled a one gallon jar with water. Then took a full iodine dropper and drip by drip, it went into the jar. It wasn't long before the water completely changed.This is why immigration needs to be controlled. We either control the drip or suffer the consequences for not doing so. "}

Its why they protect corrupt Biden and crucify Trump. They give them healthcare, legal aid, food, shelter, even created sanctuary cities to protect them from prosecution. In June 2023, Los Angeles became a sanctuary city by the Democratic run City Council. If re-elected, Trump stops them by continuing the wall Biden stopped. That is why they persecute him. That's why they protect Biden at all cost. They know they can beat the other candidates. Trump is the problem. If a Democrat wins the Presidency, the Democrat Party importation of voters continues. 15 million becomes 30 million. The Democrats will flip every battleground state to them. The Republicans will not be able to elect a President or a Senator. It will be almost impossible to elect a Congressman or Congresswoman. Its all about the border. The Republicans and Trump should tell America EVERYDAY why the Democrats are persecuting him and protecting Biden - it's all about the border and the Democrat Party's plan to take over America - and become our DICTATORS.
